        <description>Archaeologists have used digital media in a variety of ways to try to reach new audiences. I want you to explore the following sites and annotate what you find, using our hypothes.is reading group (nb don&amp;rsquo;t use the &amp;lsquo;public&amp;rsquo; group!), tying what you&amp;rsquo;re seeing to ideas you encountered in the readings.
 https://www.dayofarchaeology.com/ (worldwide) and Ben Marwick&amp;rsquo;s Analysis of the posts Archaeology in the Community (US) http://www.archaeologyincommunity.com/ DigVentures (UK) https://digventures.com/  Then, I want you to actually sign up and complete some of the possible &amp;lsquo;citizen science&amp;rsquo; tasks at Micropasts (UK) https://crowdsourced.</description>

        <description>Please do not feel that you have to do this on your own. In the binder that you will load up, there is a feature to start a video chat from within the binder. Make use of that! When you click on it, it&amp;rsquo;ll give you a code. Share that with people in this class (or friends outside the class who might be able to help). If someone does help you, just add their name to the appropriate spot in the document that will result from this exercise.</description>

        <description>Building a website from scratch can be onerous. Using a system like Wordpress or Squarespace etc can leave you locked in to someone else&amp;rsquo;s platform (and any security issues that might entail).
Here, we&amp;rsquo;re going to build a simple website that uses nothing but text files as its source; these text files will always be readable into the future, and you can also copy them to your own machine so that they&amp;rsquo;re always handy, ready to be transformed into something else.</description>
