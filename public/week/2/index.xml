        <description>Annotate this page with hypothesis while being logged into our course reading group with connections to other things you&amp;rsquo;ve read or thought about during your studies. If you spot an interesting annotation by someone else and it strikes a chord, respond generously to the annotation. Introduction I wanted you to have some experience of collecting data, and of how data models (or our expectations of what we&amp;rsquo;ll find) influence the subsequent work that we can do with the information that we collect.</description>
