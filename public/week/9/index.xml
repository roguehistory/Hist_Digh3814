        <description>ADS, Open Context, tDAR
explain, have them look around, see the csvs
Working with data deposited in ADS. Code is an adaptation of Rachel Optiz&amp;rsquo;s notebook, &amp;lsquo;Exploring published data from the ADS&amp;rsquo;. Dr. Opitz&amp;rsquo;s work is written in Python, if you want to take a look at how she does it.
Introduction Any data published as CSV files with the ADS can be pulled into R for exploration, asking your own questions with it, and generally doing research.</description>

        <description>the saa2017 package too: let them load this up and explore: another example of archaeologists communicating (note the packages that have to be installed; use the install button)
they don&amp;rsquo;t have to complete all the stuff in this one, but there are enough examples in this to keep them going forever.
have them use something from in here on graveyards data.
or at least, identify something they&amp;rsquo;d like to use on graveyards data once they figure things out (in the install_packages folder there&amp;rsquo;s basic_gis_not_using_sf that has point pattern analysis in it that might be useful, although might not be able to install in our virtual machine)</description>

        <description>This exercise might be very difficult. Ben Marwick argues that
or do hope&amp;rsquo;s report?
  have them open the notebook first; then the console; then git clone the replicable teaching thing of Ben&amp;rsquo;s.
  then they can open Rstudio.
  have them skim over the original paper by Ben https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416513000470?via%3Dihub
  have them see his data at https://figshare.com/articles/Stone_artefacts_and_human_ecology_at_two_rockshelters_in_Northwest_Thailand/765252
  let them run the modified version of the code (not Rmd), tell them what it&amp;rsquo;s doing</description>
