You should read the discord page if you\u0026rsquo;re new to that platform.\n  Log your reflection in your appropriate github repository\n  When/if you run into trouble, take screenshots (google how to do that for your particular machine) and these can be uploaded into your repository as well.

I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.\r Record and Reflect   Being a digital archaeologist means keeping track of what you’ve done, as a gift to your future self (ie, so that when you come back to something, you can pick up where you left off). Make a new text document, and put into it any new terms you’ve encountered, commands you used, error messages you encountered, websites that helped, and so on: this document is a lab notebook, as it were. Bullet points and memos-to-self are fine. Put this text document into your private week one repo on github, along with any other files or digital things you happen to make. Call it your ‘notes.md’.\n  In a new text document, jot down some reflections -narrative, or bullet points, both are fine. Call it ‘journal.md’ This document also goes into your private week one repo on github. Detail any issues you had with getting started, any parts that caused you difficulty. If you got any error messages while trying to get set up, copy those into your reflection; google them. Do you find any websites that help you? What kind of ‘failures’ might you have encountered this week?\n  Drawing on your annotations of what you’ve read (and/or your notes from what you’ve listened to), discuss your idea of what ‘digital archaeology\u0026rsquo; might be prior to starting this course, and think through whether any of the materials we’ve seen this week confirm or upset those notions. What kind of archaeology have you encountered so far at Carleton, if at all? Where do you want to go, with digital archaeology?\nLog Your Work You can log the link to your private repository on this form.

Just make sure to acknowledge all and any collaboration.\nIf a binder loads you up directly into RStudio, you can get to the Jupyter screen by copying the url to a new tab in your browser, and then deleting the last bit of the url, the /rstudio/ bit.

Epoiesen - A Journal for Creative Engagement in History and Archaeology has published a number of pieces that use a wide variety of modes to tell the story, from photo essays to time lapse art to papercraft.\nFor this exercise, I want you to scratch that creative itch. I\u0026rsquo;m open to just about anything; if you have some sort of art or media practice you\u0026rsquo;d like to employ, by all means, go ahead. If however you\u0026rsquo;re a bit like me - I\u0026rsquo;m all thumbs - you might want a bit of support. Below are two suggestions and supporting materials.\nAs you design and implement your piece, keep notes or \u0026lsquo;paradata\u0026rsquo; on what you\u0026rsquo;re doing and why - make explicit connections with the readings. The pieces on Epoiesen can serve as models for paradata.\nThe theme of your piece: a creative engagement with the graveyard project, and your work on that material.\nTwo suggestions: sonification, or photo-essay. I may add more supporting materials.\nSonification Gravestone inscriptions frequently mention the data. If we represented our class graveyard data in sound, what patterns might we hear? What might those patterns reflect in the lived experiences of those communities? Use this binder and adapt the code in the \u0026lsquo;intro to sonification\u0026rsquo; notebook to represent your gravestone data. Then, you may download the .midi files and use something like Garageband or other music editing software to assign instrumentation, or remix as appropriate. A piece I made with Eric Kansa and Andrew Reinhard, \u0026lsquo;Reflexivity\u0026rsquo; actually used a web app called Two Tone to generate the original soundlines (we then remixed). You can give TwoTone a play around as well.\nPhoto Essay A photoessay can be put together using a static gh-pages site (which you learned about last week); simply add photos and work your narrative around them. But if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for more of a challenge, exposé is a site generator that will take a folder of images and turn it into a website; you then upload all of the generated files (and images) to a new repository. In the new repository, go to \u0026lsquo;settings\u0026rsquo; and under \u0026lsquo;gh-pages\u0026rsquo; set the branch to serve from as \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo;.\n  You will need to install ImageMagick; scroll on that page until you find the version that matches your computer. Mac users will need to install homebrew first in order to follow the ImageMagick installation instructions.\n  Once you get ImageMagick installed, download exposé and unzip it.\n  Create a working folder on your machine. (Right click in your file explorer or finder and create new folder).\n  Move your image folder into that folder (ie, your image folder is now a subfolder).\n  Start a command prompt in your folder (PC: in the address bar in your file explorer, you can click and then type cmd. Hit enter. A black window will open; this is the command prompt.) Mac users - from Applications search for or select \u0026lsquo;terminal\u0026rsquo;. Then, look at the path to your folder in finder. In the terminal, type cd path\\to\\your\\workfolder and hit enter.\n  We now want to tell your computer where the expose.sh command is - remember, it\u0026rsquo;s in that folder you downloaded from github. Take a look at the path to where it is, and then, at the command prompt, type alias expose=/script/location/expose.sh where everything after the = sign is the path or location of the expose.sh file.\n  Now let\u0026rsquo;s build a photoessay! At the command prompt, cd imagefolder where \u0026lsquo;imagefolder\u0026rsquo; is the name of the subfolder with all of your images. Then, at the prompt: expose. Boom!\n  Now the text for your images: make text files for each image. If the image is \u0026lsquo;sunny-day.png\u0026rsquo;, the associated text should be in \u0026lsquo;sunny-day.txt\u0026rsquo;. To control the order, change the names to have numbers at the start, eg \u0026lsquo;05-sunny-dat.txt\u0026rsquo;. (Names will be sorted alphabetically).\n  Examine the resulting folder.\n  Step.works Stepworks is a newish service that uses the idea of the \u0026lsquo;single tap\u0026rsquo; as the interaction that moves you through a multi-media piece; in its own words, \u0026ldquo;Stepworks turns just about anything into an embeddable digital instrument you can perform with clicks, taps, or keypresses. All you need is Google Sheets.\u0026rdquo;\nThe idea is that each column in a spreadsheet can be a kind of \u0026lsquo;voice\u0026rsquo;, while each row is what should happen on a subsequent tap. Spreadsheets then get loaded into a \u0026lsquo;stage\u0026rsquo; that has different kinds of interactions or layouts. One looks like a text message screen; another can handle a kind of splitscreen effect (it reminds me of the opening to any Marvel movie, when the big \u0026lsquo;MARVEL\u0026rsquo; logo appears).\nNow, it\u0026rsquo;s still in beta, so there are some rough edges; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to use https (just plain ol\u0026rsquo; http) so you might get some security warnings. If you do, and your browser just doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to play with it, then you might as well stop because it\u0026rsquo;s not something that we, on our end, can fix.\nBut if it does work for you, I find that tapping with the space bar works best once you\u0026rsquo;re looking at something.\n  Create a new google spreadsheet by copying this one to your account.\n  You can add some more characters just by putting their name at the top of the columns, one name to one column.\n  Your sheet can get complicated; you can mix in videos and other multimedia, as in the image below, if the stage you choose to use accepts that.\n   When you\u0026rsquo;re ready, go to \u0026lsquo;file\u0026rsquo; and hit \u0026lsquo;publish to the web\u0026rsquo;. Accept whatever it says. Then, don\u0026rsquo;t copy the url that the pop up gives you. Dismiss the pop up, and then copy the url in your address bar.\n  Go to https://step.works/index.php/stage and select the kind of stage you want to use.\n  Hit the \u0026lsquo;load\u0026rsquo; button, and then select \u0026lsquo;google sheets\u0026rsquo; and paste the url in there.\n   Do you see that button \u0026lsquo;notes\u0026rsquo; at the bottom? If you click on that, special commands that you can enter to customize your work for the particular affordances of a particular stage will appear. Not every stage will display all of the same material. So do check those \u0026lsquo;notes\u0026rsquo; as you develop.\n  Every stage\u0026rsquo;s url is constructed the same way. That means you can try the different stages, and just paste in the bit from the ?sheets= onwards (from the ? on!) after the url to the stage, eg:\n  See what you can come up with, and share the link (you could try embedding it in your github repo for this week too).  ","description":"On Creative Engagement","id":11,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Digital Creativity","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/11/creativity/"},{"content":"Introduction Photogrammetry is the process whereby multiple photographs of an object are stitched together to make a 3d model of the object; the photographs are then draped over the model to make it photorealistic. Because of the physics of photography (focal distances of lenses and so on) a computer can calculate the relative positioning of overlapping points it identifies in multiple photographs, and with a bit of trig it works out the points-in-space. Then it joins these points up by connecting to the nearest neighbouring points, creating a series of triangles or \u0026lsquo;mesh\u0026rsquo;.\nA common digital format then for these models is a folder with a .obj file describing the geometry of the object, a .png file with all of the texture information, and a .mtl file that tells the computer how to drape the texture onto the model. Services like sketchfab.com let you upload a zip file of such a folder, and then display or annotate the object. Here\u0026rsquo;s one I did of a gravestone of one of the Moodie family burials:\n Gravestone2 by electricarchaeo on Sketchfab  Getting Started   Read the small section on photogrammetry in ODATE\n  Select one of the gravestones in the cemetery that you are working on. If that\u0026rsquo;s not possible, you can try making a model of an object in your house.\n  If you have an actual digital camera, use that. If you don\u0026rsquo;t, your cell phone camera can work. You will need to take photos of all sides of the stone/object such that you have sufficient overlap of each image. Around 20 photographs can do it. You might circle the object three times, once at a low level, once at the middle, and once around the top (if feasible).\n Transfer your photographs to a folder on your computer; if you have a google drive account, you might want to move them there.\n  An actual digital camera embeds metadata about focal length in each image that the photogrammetry process will use. Most cellphone cameras do not. If you are using cellphone images, please follow these instructions to embed metadata into your images.\n  Making a 3d model You have two options here.\n  Use Google\u0026rsquo;s own computing resources to stitch a model together for you with a piece of software called \u0026lsquo;Meshroom\u0026rsquo;. To do this, right-click and open this notebook in a new window. You run each cell in that notebook starting at the top - select the cell, then hit run. When it finishes, select the next cell, and hit run. That notebook has instructions on uploading your images directly, or connecting to your google drive folder. Read carefully before hitting run! The process might take a bit of time.\n  Download and use Regard3d, an open source collection of algorithms for making 3d models, on your own computer. Download Regard3 and then follow its tutorial; you can then re-do its steps on the folder of your own images. Remember: you need to add the metadata to your photos if the camera you used isn\u0026rsquo;t a standard camera.\n  Upload your finished model to Sketchfab.com; the free version only allows 1 upload per month. Another option is https://p3d.in; models there can only be max 100 mb in size. There are other options too that you can find with a bit of googling. It might well be that your model is quite wonky - perhaps you didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough photos in the right places. How is the process of taking photographs similar to the kind of close reading you might do in a history class?\n  You can also drag and drop your model files (.obj, .mtl, .png) into your github repo for this week.\n  ","description":"Creating 3d Models from Photographs","id":12,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Photogrammetry","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/3/photogrammetry/"},{"content":"Consolidation Pause I Goals for this week  Use this time to catch up on anything you didn\u0026rsquo;t read, to try some of the exercises over again, and to consolidate what you\u0026rsquo;ve achieved so far.

There are digital archaeologies that focus on the work in the field, towards ever better practices and data collection. There are digital archaeologies that try to upend our notions of what it means to publish archaeological work. There are digital archaeologies that aim to immerse us in the past. This is not an exhaustive list.\nThe fact is, the digital extends our cognition in ways - for good and for ill - that we still are only in the opening stages of grappling with. The fundamental action of a computer is to copy, and so the choices we make when we render something computable have unforeseen and often unintended consequences when these choices scale up and multiply. When we use computation and digital tools in archaeology, the tool is making us even as we use it to make an understanding of the past/present.\nI want therefore to extend an invitation to you to explore these issues further. There are a variety of ways you might do this. Perhaps you explore these issues in your coursework in other classes. Perhaps you apply to my X-Lab. Perhaps you apply for the Graham Undergraduate Digital History Research Fellowship. I have supervised undergraduate Honours research projects (HIST4910, 1.0 credit) in the past on the historical consciousness of Dwarf Fortress, and on Bronze Age feasting (using network analysis) - just to give you an idea of the range of things I\u0026rsquo;m prepared to support. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;re thinking of grad school and want to bounce some ideas around. If any of this sort of thing sparks your interest, then let\u0026rsquo;s talk. I\u0026rsquo;m open to ideas. We might not have an archaeology degree at Carleton, but archaeological ways of knowing can be explored many ways.\n","description":"Your Own Digital Archaeology","id":14,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"An Invitation","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/12-5/an-invitation/"},{"content":"Introduction Humans have made virtual worlds since time immemorial (see, for instance, Lascaux). Hadrian\u0026rsquo;s Villa at Tivoli was a virtual world. Disney World is a virtual world. Online is a virtual world but it\u0026rsquo;s still the real world.\nAs this map put together by Andrew Reinhard and I suggests, there are a lot of dimensions to archaeogaming. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s still on Netflix, but the \u0026lsquo;Atari: Game Over\u0026rsquo; documentary is worth a look because it is a case of quite literal archaeology of video games.\nMost of the time, no one excavates physical video games. But we do do work inside video games, and archaeologists do sometimes help design video games - Tara Copplestone, in \u0026lsquo;Designing and Developing a Playful Past in Video Games\u0026rsquo; has written on the tension between good archaeology and good game design, and it\u0026rsquo;s well worth your time to read.\nFor my money, a video game does one thing really well: it teaches the player how to play it. If you\u0026rsquo;re really good at the game, you\u0026rsquo;ve internalized its representation of the world. And that\u0026rsquo;s why archaeologists need to think about storytelling, and ethics, and representation in video games. (More from me along this vein in this article.)\nBut there are other ways of approaching the worlds created in video games as archaeological spaces. This week, I\u0026rsquo;ll suggest three options.\nOption 1: Graves and memorialization in-world Here, I want you to select a game that you know well that includes within it graveyards or other memorials to the dead. Off the top of my head, I could imagine Dwarf Fortress, Dragon Age Inquisition, Witcher, or the Assassins\u0026rsquo; Creed franchise. And then I want you to record gravestones and other monuments in the game, using our KoboToolBox recording system that we used for the Graveyard Project.\n(This work is not without precedent; see the archaeological survey of worlds in the No Man\u0026rsquo;s Sky universe; there was even a code of ethics developed to guide that research.\nBut, but\u0026hellip; games aren\u0026rsquo;t real worlds! What good would it be to study memorialization in there?\nVirtual worlds are still human worlds, and the way death is memorialized in there might also provide us insight to how we construct death out here. Archaeology isn\u0026rsquo;t just about the past, remember. We spend a great deal of our waking hours in these virtual worlds. Perhaps studying memorialization in-world will give us insight into memorializations of the future? Perhaps it might tell us about how people form social relationships in-world? Let\u0026rsquo;s find out.\nGo into the game, and take screenshots. Then, working from your screenshots, record them in our system. Think about, and record, the ways memorialization is constructed in these games, and how it is similar/different from the \u0026lsquo;real world\u0026rsquo; data.\nOption 2: Craft a \u0026lsquo;barely\u0026rsquo; game Rob MacDougall introduced me to the idea of \u0026lsquo;barely games\u0026rsquo; years ago. With this option, I want you to devise a \u0026lsquo;barely game\u0026rsquo; that could be played with our graveyards data.\nThis is for the entirely practical reason that designing and building games takes a lot of time and effort. Thus, your game might -\n be built in Twine; there are many tutorials on how to achieve different effects with Twine; you might start with the Twine Cookbook be built with Bitsy something else that you know of that I haven\u0026rsquo;t encountered. Key thing is: this has to be something achievable in a few days.  Option 3: Game Design Document Another possibility is to sketch out a game design document for something a little bit more complex than a barely game, but certainly not as complex as a first person shooter. Maybe a deck builder? Something where the main gameplay maps onto the ways digital arcaheology looks at the world. (templates abound online; here\u0026rsquo;s one). I emphasize again: sketch. Focus on aesthetics and gameplay. Key element: it must use the information collected by this class.\n","description":"Play the Past","id":15,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Archaeogaming","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/11/archaeogaming/"},{"content":"Introduction In this exercise, we\u0026rsquo;re working with data deposited in ADS.

Augmented and virtual realities were always a part of the scene, in the stuff I read. I\u0026rsquo;ve spent a lot of time over the past ten years or so trying to bring those visions to life, given the level of my tech chops and the available technologies I had to play with, with various degrees of success. I shelled out for an Oculus Rift SDK v2, put it on, plumbed it into Minecraft, and promptly had to lie down for three hours because my head went one way and my body went the other.\nI get motion sick. VR just doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for me. But AR - and other kinds of \u0026lsquo;mixed\u0026rsquo; realities - seems to me to hold out much more promise. When I have gone field walking with accomplished landscape archaeologists, they see so much more than I do, because they know how to read the landscape, and their imaginations, training, and knowledge come together to build up a vision of the space that is far more full than what I can see. Stu Eve wrote his PhD thesis using augmented reality to understand the Bronze Age landscapes of Bodmin Moor, and his work is fascinating; well worth checking out. That work used early iPads as a kind of hand-held window into the past. Hand-held AR - well, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make me motion sick, and if we think of these devices as opening magic windows (link is to a mixed reality demo by the Emotive Project)\u0026hellip; I can get behind that.\nA few years ago I wrote\n The thing about hand-held AR is that you have to account for why. Why this device? Why are you looking through it at a page, or a bill board, or a magazine, or what-have-you? It’s not at all natural. The various Cardboard-like viewers out there are a step up, in that they free the hands (and with the see-through camera, feel more Geordi LaForge).\n  [\u0026hellip;] Without the story, it’s just gee-whiz look at what I can do. It’s somehow not authentic. That’s one of the reasons various museum apps that employ AR tricks haven’t really taken off I think. The corollary of this (and I’m just thinking out loud here) is that AR can’t be divorced from the tools and techniques of game based storytelling (narrative/ludology, whatever).\n I can teach you the technical elements of putting together a simple augmented reality web-app. But the storytelling, the framing, the \u0026lsquo;why am I doing this with my phone\u0026rsquo; - that\u0026rsquo;s the harder part. In this exercise then, I want you to reuse the 3d model you built in week 3 and put it into physical space. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use a tool called AR.js that delivers AR via html. (Other options are possible - Unity for instance can be used to make both location based and image-based AR).\nSome terms:\nLocation based AR: your device reads your position in physical space and overlays \u0026lsquo;assets\u0026rsquo; (3d models, audio, video, text) tied to those spaces\nMarker based AR: your device recognizes a marker graphic (like a QR code) and overlays the assets on that marker\nImage based AR: your device recognizes distinct images (paintings, photos, logos, etc) and overlays the assets tied to that image (here\u0026rsquo;s ane example from MoMA; here\u0026rsquo;s an example by public history grad students at Carleton).\nLocation Based Ar with a 3d Model There are many tutorials out there on using AR.js. We\u0026rsquo;re going to do a modified version of these:\nAkash Kuttappa, 2017\nNicolò Carpignoli, 2019.\nAnd the quickstart from AR.js itself.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to build a website that you load up on your phone, and which will then read your location and put the 3d model of one of your gravestones into that space. What kind of \u0026lsquo;story\u0026rsquo; will you write to make that action \u0026lsquo;sensible\u0026rsquo; or inevitable or entirely reasonable? What story do you tell to make it compelling to do this?\nSetting things up   Download your 3d model from Sketchfab in gltf format. This will give you a zipped folder; unzip it.\n  Create a new public repository on github for this exercise; initialize it with a readme file. Call the repo ar-demo.\n  Drag and drop the unzipped folder for your model into the repo. Commit your changes.\n  Create a new file in that repo and call it index.html. nb This file lives at the same level as your readme.md file, not inside your model folder.\n  Building your webpage Now, because we\u0026rsquo;re using a web based technology, we have to load the various scripts that we\u0026rsquo;re going to use. We do that inside the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; tag of the webpage, like so:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta http-equiv=\u0026#34;X-UA-Compatible\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;IE=edge\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;HIST3000 AR demo\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://aframe.io/releases/1.0.4/aframe.min.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://unpkg.com/aframe-look-at-component@0.8.0/dist/aframe-look-at-component.min.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar-nft.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt;   Those three \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tags tell your browser to reach out and grab the javascript packages that will enable the augmented reality. Commit your changes.\n Find the location you wish to augment in decimal degrees. I sometimes use Google Earth to do this. If you go to Google Earth, and search a location, the latitude and longitude will turn up in your URL. For instance, if I wanted to augment the centre of the Quad at Carleton University, I would search for Carleton U in Google Earth, and then zoom in until I had the quad in the centre of the screen (double clicking in the middle to make sure). This URL https://earth.google.com/web/search/carleton+university/@45.3823833,-75.69885509,72.33333211a,51.2940786d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CigiJgokCUUI4Yny6j5AEbHSDo4ACjlAGfM35yrZKEzAIVBSUjKtRVHA shows you exactly what I\u0026rsquo;m looking at. The bit I want is the bit after carleton+university/@, or 45.3823833, -75.69885509. Copy that somewhere safe.\n  Now we\u0026rsquo;re going to build the \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;. If you committed your changes back in step 5, you need to hit the \u0026lsquo;edit\u0026rsquo; button. We\u0026rsquo;ll set up a basic opening  tag: \u0026lt;body style=\u0026quot;margin: 0; overflow: hidden;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n  Now we\u0026rsquo;ll start defining some of the AR.js tags that will deliver us some augmented reality. We open and define an  tag:\n  1 2 3 4  \u0026lt;a-scene vr-mode-ui=\u0026#34;enabled: false\u0026#34; embedded arjs=\u0026#39;sourceType: webcam; sourceWidth:1280; sourceHeight:960; displayWidth: 1280; displayHeight: 960; debugUIEnabled: false;\u0026#39; \u0026gt;    The next bit tells the camera to be aware of rotation: \u0026lt;a-camera gps-camera rotation-reader\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/a-camera\u0026gt;\n  And now we tell it the location of our 3d model, and where to pin it to the world:\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  \u0026lt;a-entity gltf-model=\u0026#34;gravestone3/scene.gltf\u0026#34; rotation=\u0026#34;0 180 0\u0026#34; scale=\u0026#34;0.15 0.15 0.15\u0026#34; gps-entity-place=\u0026#34;latitude: 45.3823833; longitude: -75.69885509;\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026lt;/a-entity\u0026gt;   Where I have gravestone3/scene.gltf you\u0026rsquo;ll have the folder name for your model. The rotation and scale elements define how the model will look in the physical space.\nNow we just close the open tags:  1 2 3  \u0026lt;/a-scene\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;   \u0026hellip;and commit our changes. One last element: we have to tell Github to serve this page up on the web. Go to the cogwheel \u0026lsquo;settings\u0026rsquo; icon and scroll down to Github Pages. Under the drop down under \u0026lsquo;Source\u0026rsquo; select \u0026lsquo;Master\u0026rsquo;. Github will build the html and make it available at a location (it\u0026rsquo;ll reload and say \u0026lsquo;your page is published at\u0026hellip;') which will most likely be your-username.github.io/ar-demo/ . Grab your smartphone, fire up its browser (Firefox works well) and go to that URL. Give it permission to access your location and backwards facing camera. Carefully scan around you, slowly\u0026hellip; your model should appear! (Assuming you\u0026rsquo;re standing more or less at the location whose coordinates you added).\nConclusion This is a very basic example of something that could be done. If you explore the tutorial links I shared up above, you should be able to build more complex experiences. You could, for instance, set up relative positioning, so that assets appear in space relative to the user, wherever they may be. You could then code in all of your gravestones, and bring the graveyard to your users. You could set things up so that text or location markers appear. You could set things up so that audio plays, and the voices of the dead whisper to you\u0026hellip;\n  (For more about this video, see \u0026lsquo;Hearing the Past\u0026rsquo;.)\n","description":"Merge the Digital with the Physical","id":17,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Augmented Reality","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/11/augmented-reality/"},{"content":"Annotate this page with hypothesis while being logged into our course reading group with connections to other things you\u0026rsquo;ve read or thought about during your studies. If you spot an interesting annotation by someone else and it strikes a chord, respond generously to the annotation. Introduction I wanted you to have some experience of collecting data, and of how data models (or our expectations of what we\u0026rsquo;ll find) influence the subsequent work that we can do with the information that we collect. \u0026lsquo;Data\u0026rsquo; means things given but the goal (a goal) of this exercise is to see this information more like \u0026lsquo;capta\u0026rsquo; or things created/crafted/captured.\nArchaeology has some well established models for capturing the observations made at the trowel\u0026rsquo;s edge. In the UK for instance (where I did most of my archaeological training) the \u0026lsquo;single context\u0026rsquo; recording system as developed by the Museum of London Archaeology Service is more or less used (with variations) everywhere. (Here\u0026rsquo;s the manual).\nWe clearly can\u0026rsquo;t dig anything, in this time of Covid (and besides, it takes time to obtain a license to excavate in Ontario; looking at monuments in cemeteries however doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall under the rubric of the archaeological licensing scheme). We will be looking at archaeological data collected by others (from places like the Archaeological Data Service), but it seemed to me that you should experience just how much variability, reflexivity, and creativity is involved in trying to systematically collect information. Morgan and Eddisford argue (2019) that\n the introduction of single context recording not only had a dramatic impact on the way in which archaeology was undertaken, but also revolutionized the way social relations on site were structured. Single context recording promotes individual empowerment of diggers, allowing them to contribute to collective knowledge construction on site. Equally, it promoted a more horizontal management structure.\n In a way, the scheme that we are going to use (adapted from \u0026lsquo;Discovering England\u0026rsquo;s Burial Spaces\u0026rsquo; is similar to what Morgan and Eddisford say about single context recording: one grave at a time, you (plural) build up a broader picture of what is going on. But recognize this too: how we record data has an impact not just on the past, but the present (see also Perry 2018, 217)\nMortuary Archaeology The study of graveyards is one point where history and archaeology intersect, as both disciplines have their own bodies of literature connected with exploring how humans have dealt with their dead. I remember being taught as an undergrad the concept of seriation with reference to motifs on New England headstones (\u0026lsquo;Death\u0026rsquo;s Head, Cherub, Urn and Willow\u0026rsquo; by Deetz and Dethlefsen.)\nThe count of headstones with different motifs, when organized according to date of death, demonstrates how fashions evolve even within gravestone motifs. Which also means you can use a motif to suggest a likely date for a stone\u0026hellip;\nNow, mortuary archaeology as a branch of bioarchaeology has tended to focus more on the human remains (an overview by Bettina Arnold and Robert Jeske is available here).\nIn my own research (The Bone Trade Project) I am looking at how and why people buy human remains (which they do these days over Facebook and Instagram) using computer vision and machine learning (artificial intelligence). Many of the people whose remains are now being traded were stolen from their graves; many never even made it to the grave (people who died homeless, for instance, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could be claimed by schools of anatomy for dissection).\nOntario has a history of grave robbing as well - I found this notice in the Shawville Equity:\n “Dr. Eberson, a dentist well known through-out the Ottawa Valley, was found drowned in the Rideau Lake near Portland recently, and his body was interred in the cemetary at that place. A few days since it was found that the body had been stolen by human ghouls. The coffin was kicked in and badly damaged by the graverobbers\u0026hellip; No trace of the body has yet been discovered. “ – Shawville Equity, October 9 1890\n Katie Daubs, writing in the Toronto Star, has a long piece on the history of grave robbing in Ontario.\nA project looking at graveyards and gravestones therefore sets us up to talk about digital archaeology in a number of powerful and compelling ways.\nConclusion So it seemed to me that a project where we explored local graveyards would tie together many of the strands that I wanted this class to weave together. The information that you collect will be used later in the course for some statistical analysis, and for the eventual final outputs that we put together. The issues that all of this will raise, the techniques that you will be exposed to, the literature: all of these will help push you towards an ethical digital archaeology.\nWhen the day comes that you will work with other kinds of digital archaeological data, you will be able to revisit your notes and journal and have a head start on whatever task it is you wish to do.\n","description":"Rationale","id":18,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Graveyard Project Rationale","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/2/rationale/"},{"content":"Introduction   The KoBoToolbox is an open source platform that allows you to design quite complex data collection forms, for use via computers or devices, both online and offline.\nIpads and similar have been used in archaeology since their invention, at places for example like Pompeii and other sites destroyed by Vesuvius. The potential applications for devices like this to speed up data acquisition and analysis practically fill entire volumes, but at the same time, leave some archaeologists worried that we\u0026rsquo;re missing something fundamental about doing archaeology, that we need a \u0026lsquo;slow\u0026rsquo; archaeology to counter them. What actually constitutes the virtues of \u0026lsquo;slowness\u0026rsquo;, and whether or not digital work is \u0026lsquo;slow\u0026rsquo; is up for debate (and of course, I have my own views on the matter\u0026hellip;)\nSuffice it to say, designing and implementing digital recording has not been an easy thing to do, and it has theoretical and ethical implications. KoBoToolbox aims to flatten that curve (and the fact that it is open source and aimed at humanitarian work adds an ethical dimension to its use).\nHere, I will provide you with the template file that I created for our class and our own recording adventure, which is an adaptation of the DEBS recording sheet created for recording English burial grounds. You will use it to make your own graveyard recording system, but you will modify/delete those elements that you believe are not appropriate to our Canadian context, and/or add elements to take into account our particular situation, in the light of your engagement so far with the system and our readings.\nYou can take screenshots of modifications you make, adding them to a brief text document you\u0026rsquo;ll keep as a record of why and what you did; the document can also have the link to the deployed form.\nIncidentally, once you\u0026rsquo;ve got the form deployed, and filled it a couple of times, you can see the built-in visualization and analytical tools that KoBoToolbox provises as well.\nModify the Form   You will need my graveyard recording form template.

Some fire in response to various colours. Some fire in response to light and shadow. Imagine that these cells are arranged in layers. If those simple cells in the first layer fire, they pass a signal to the next layer up. The cells in that layer might only fire if they get enough \u0026lsquo;activations\u0026rsquo; from the previous layer. Each layer in turn receives the input of more and more complicated patterns of connections from the previous layer. Eventually, the brain receives the signal.\nA biologist might read that paragraph, and shudder. Neural networks have long been around in the field of artificial intelligence, and they\u0026rsquo;ve been modelled after that simple analogy. Since about 2012 or so, the field of neural networks has exploded with the raw computing power of commercial grade GPUs. The key to the recent explosion has been this combination of raw computing power, large million image datasets, and the idea of allowing inputs to back propogated along the network: basically, if you put enough images of a dog in front of the neural network, the average pattern of connection and firing could be labelled \u0026lsquo;dog\u0026rsquo;; then if a picture of, say, a cat was put in front of the network, the distance or similarity of the firing could be compared to that we know for \u0026lsquo;dog\u0026rsquo; and a score computed. Put enough pictures of cats in front of the neural network, and the network learns what \u0026lsquo;cats\u0026rsquo; look like.\nI simplify enormously, of course, but that\u0026rsquo;s the gist. The neat thing is, once you\u0026rsquo;ve got a network trained on thousands of different kinds of things - which takes enormous computing power and resources - you can retrain just the last layer of the network with new data, to teach it what something looks like that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t trained on. Retrain the network on pictures of Roman pottery, and it will learn what different kinds of Roman pottery look like (but you can\u0026rsquo;t use it for dogs any more). The network lights up in a particular way when it encounters pictures of verenice nera, and we can say: this pattern = verenice nera, with a given probability.\n(For a discussion on the use of neural networks in archaeology, see Baxter 2014).\nIndeed, you don\u0026rsquo;t even need to have labelled categories of things for a pretrained neural network to be useful. The Yale DH Lab uses a neural network without that final layer to find image similarity: it shows images to the network, and computes the distance between how the network lights up for one image versus a different image. This distance can then be expressed in two-dimensional space, and you end up with a visualization of visual similarity! See their repository here.\nExercise In this exercise, you\u0026rsquo;re going to re-train a neural network on a small dataset of Roman pottery images.\n  In our course repository I have created a notebook containing all of the code necessary to build a simple image classifier that you will train on some Roman pottery wares. Hit the blue \u0026lsquo;open in colab\u0026rsquo; button. The notebook assumes you have a Google drive account. You will need to upload the image data zipped folder (clicking the link should start a download to your machine).\n  Read the notebook carefully, and make sure to run each cell in sequence, letting a cell complete before you run the next one. Also, you need to make sure that the notebook settings for hardware acceleration are set to \u0026lsquo;gpu\u0026rsquo; (see the getting started block in the notebook).\n  ","description":"The Automated Archaeologist","id":23,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Neural Networks \u0026 Computer Vision","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/7/computer-vision/"},{"content":"  Read ODATE 4.4 - 4.4.1.3\n  Download and install Netlogo for your machine (there is an option called \u0026lsquo;Netlogo Web\u0026rsquo;, which runs in your browser.

If we trained a language model on my writing, the changes that the word \u0026lsquo;social\u0026rsquo; would be followed by \u0026lsquo;network\u0026rsquo; would be very high, if the rest of the text contained words like \u0026lsquo;links\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;edges\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;power\u0026rsquo;. Since the language model we\u0026rsquo;re using is trained on over 8 million websites, lord only knows what it has \u0026lsquo;learned\u0026rsquo;. Models of this kind are famous for reproducing the biases and toxic language of the internet, so they must be used with caution.\nBut, once we have such a language, we can perturb it or re-train its final outputs by giving it a specific body of information. Once we\u0026rsquo;ve done that, we can prompt the model with strings of text to collapse the possible responses. If we retrain GPT-2 with the writings of Lanciani, we\u0026rsquo;ll have a kind of simLanciani that we can interrogate.\nAt this point, we are so far off the map we\u0026rsquo;d need a map just to find the map again. What is the truth value of anything that simLanciani might say? Is it just a toy? Or could there be a route through to archaeological enchantment this way?\n  Go to this copy of Max Woolf\u0026rsquo;s notebook. That link will open the notebook in Google Colab. (You can preview a static version of the notebook here.)\n  in the cell \u0026lsquo;Downloading GPT2\u0026rsquo; we want to load the slightly larger model, the 355 mb sized one. Change the code to:\n  gpt2.download_gpt2(model_name=\u0026quot;355M\u0026quot;)  The notebook contains code for connecting to your google drive, so that you can save the trained model once it\u0026rsquo;s finished to your drive. If you do this, you can reload and return to generating text at a later time.\n  We\u0026rsquo;re going to use the wget command to copy Lanciani\u0026rsquo;s 1892 book Pagan and Christian Rome to the notebook; this will be the text that we retrain the model on. Highlight (click on) the \u0026lsquo;upload\u0026rsquo; cell explaining how to upload materials, and then hit the + code button at the top of the window. In the new empty cell, add:\n  #lanciani pagan \u0026amp; christian rome 1892 !wget http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22153/22153-0.txt  Run that cell. Then change the file name= cell to file_name = \u0026quot;22153-0.txt\u0026quot;\n  In the \u0026lsquo;Fine Tune GPT2\u0026rsquo; cell, you execute the code that fine tunes the GPT-2 language model by perturbing it with Lanciani\u0026rsquo;s voice. Change the line model_name='124M', to model_name='355M',. Don\u0026rsquo;t delete the comma!\n  Run that cell. It will train the model - which\u0026rsquo;ll take a bit of time, maybe 5 minutes - and will spit out text periodically every 200 iterations to show you its state (it runs for 1000 iterations). Note that the outputted text gets more \u0026lsquo;coherent\u0026rsquo; as the model trains.\n  Once that finishes running, you can skip ahead to \u0026lsquo;Generate Text from the Trained Model\u0026rsquo;\n  This command gpt2.generate(sess, run_name='run1') just generates a text using the defaults. (The output of training is saved as \u0026lsquo;run1\u0026rsquo;) But let\u0026rsquo;s let the machine get creative. The next command,\n  gpt2.generate(sess, length=250, temperature=0.7, prefix=\u0026quot;LORD\u0026quot;, nsamples=5, batch_size=5 ) \u0026hellip;will generate a text 250 words long, and the dial for creativity is set pretty high (\u0026lsquo;temperature\u0026rsquo;, which can scale from 0.0 to 1.0). It\u0026rsquo;ll start predicting likely text from the seed \u0026ldquo;LORD\u0026rdquo; (the demo was trained on the plays of Shakespeare, so \u0026lsquo;LORD\u0026rsquo; is a cue for a character to start speaking). Change that word to something like, \u0026ldquo;Why were the early Christians a threat to Roman power?\u0026rdquo; The notebook also shows some other settings you can tune with. Give it a try!\nYou can connect the notebook to your gdrive by running the relevant cell, and then copy your retrained model to your drive. Then, you can come back to this later, re-run the initial code block (under \u0026ldquo;to get started\u0026rdquo;), load the model (\u0026ldquo;Load a trained model checkpoint\u0026rdquo;) and generate away.\nSo what do we learn from this simLanciani?\nSome of the output when I trained my model:\n Why were the early Christians a threat to Roman power? As I stated at the outset, the reason is simple: they did not believe in the Roman Empire. After the fall of the empire, Christianity took possession of the soil on which it had built its churches, and overran the Roman countryside in pursuit of its aims. To no purpose, however, was the persecution really motivated by the Christian faith. When the empire was destroyed and the new\nfoundations established, the old superstitions of the Empire, which had\nbeen so thoroughly shaken, found no outlet whatever.\n (use ctrl+f on the original source, http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22153/22153-0.txt to search the phrases.

I have been told it could not be used but once, when cutting away at a mass of thorns which was obstructing the rear entrance of a cave. In one of my earlier diaries, No. 45, I shall have a record of the unfortunate accident of my life. A woodchuck fell from one of the balconies on the fourth floor, pierced my left tibia, and wrist, and shoulder, among the many bones which littered the floor. The name of the felled bird is PHILETVS (it was aah-LEET-vah). A hortatory chapel was built around the grave, to the which it gave the name of PALMADY (please remember it, by the way).\n  What is the future of digital archaeology?\n\u0026ldquo;It is a sad state of things when one considers that, in the history of mankind, digital discoveries have yielded such a bounty that no other branch of study seems to possess a sufficient supply of material for the antiquarian synthesis.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash;H.

Or we could ask him/it questions about the social context of his work. Perhaps if you fed it a prompt about an actual archaeological site, or a historical event, you might get a new interpretation. You might think about this in the context of the work of Tiffany Chan, who used a related approach to trying to understand the work of the 19th century author Grant Allen, in her project the authorFunction. simLanciani is a kind of fun-house mirror, turned back on an important moment in the history of Roman archaeology, a distortion that perhaps reveals greater truths.\nGoing Further Try feeding (retraining) the model some modern texts; perhaps copy the text from the articles of a single modern archaeologist (open access journal articles) into a single text file, and then upload it to the notebook.\nOr if you want to get really meta, go to the source text files for this course website, copy them into a single file, paste them into gist.github.com, copy the \u0026lsquo;raw\u0026rsquo; url, and feed me into the machine\u0026hellip; what kind of course emerges?\n","description":"Language Models and Artificial Intelligence","id":25,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Raise the Dead II","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/7/raise-the-dead-ii/"},{"content":"Introduction In this tutorial, I re-purpose some instructions from my Crafting Digital History class on how to build a web map using open source code from Leaflet. The idea here is that you learn to build a map and get it online: and then you modify it to display\n the cemetery that you have worked on the location of stones  The East End Cemetery website maps a historic African American burial ground in Henrico County and the city of Richmond, Virginia, and uses Leaflet:\nEast End Cemetery Map\nWith time and practice, you would be able to build something similar. Remember, I am not expecting perfection; rather, I want you to push yourself until you get stuck.\nNb When I talk about \u0026lsquo;serving\u0026rsquo; your site in step 8, I am assuming you have python installed on your computer. If you have a mac, you probably do; if you have a PC, probably not. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to muck about with Python, you can download the free trial of prepos, which will act like a web server. Open that program, and then drag and drop the folder you are working in (always start a new project like this in a new folder) onto the prepos interface. See these instructions. Webmapping with Leaflet  The following is a modified exercise from the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook Environment by Graham et al 2019; this particular section was contributed by Neha Gupta of UBC.\n First of all, a webmap is not a Geographic Information System or GIS. A webmap may be derived from a GIS, but the key difference is that a GIS allows analytical questions to be asked of, and derived from, different layers of spatial or spatialized data. Webmaps are used more for conveying the results of such analyses.\nTiled map service and Web Map Service are two forms of Web-based mapping. A WMS is an interface that enables us (the clients) to request specific maps i.e. visual representations of geographic information from a geospatial database. The WMS server is called via a Universal Resource Link (URL) on an Internet-enabled desktop GIS. A request typically consists of the geographic layer (e.g. theme) and geographic area of interest. The response to a request results in geo-registered map images that are displayed and queried within a browser. Because the map is dynamically drawn upon request, and because the server typically uses the most current information from several layers in the geospatial database, WMS maps tend to load slowly.\nTile map services such as TileMill Project, OpenStreetMap, and Stamen all use one or more vector layers that have been rasterized into an image. This rasterized image is divided into 256 x 256 adjacent pixel images or ‘tiles’. This is usually the base layer in a web map.\nEach tile is an image on the Web, which means that you can link to it. For example, the following URL points to a specific tile on the Web:\nhttps://tile.openstreetmap.org/7/63/42.png The three elements in the URL are:\n tile.openstreetmap.org, the tile server name; 7, the zoom level or z value of the tile; and finally 63/42, the x and y values in the grid where the tile lives  The z value has a range between 0 and 21, where 21 returns a tile with greatest detail (and smallest sized tile).\n\u0026lsquo;Image Tile Pyramid, https://www.azavea.com/blog/2018/08/06/generating-pyramided-tiles-from-a-geotiff-using-geotrellis/tilepyramid/’\nOnce generated, the set of tiles are stored on disk, ready to be distributed rapidly to large numbers of simultaneous requests. Tiled maps load quickly precisely because they are pre-generated. They shift attention to map aesthetics and smooth map navigation, trading in functionality such as layer order, map scale and projection. Alex Urquhart maintains a list of tile services.\nData layers are typically added on top of the base layer. Data layers can be points, lines and polygons. These data layers are saved as GeoJSON, a format designed for representing on the Web, geographic features with their non-spatial attributes.\nLeaflet is a JavaScript library developed by Vladimir Agafonkin for use with tiled maps. Launched in 2008, Leaflet has become widely used in tile web mapping because the library’s low-barrier customization and interactivity with map elements, and because of its simplified setup when compared to a WMS served map. Moreover, Leaflet’s compatibility with other Web 2.0 technologies and code-sharing platforms such as GitHub has encouraged an active community of ‘makers’.\nYou will need a proper text editor (not notepad, not, shudder, Word) to edit your files. I suggest you download, install, and use Sublime Text.\n Create a new directory on your machine and call it \u0026lsquo;web-map\u0026rsquo; Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory. We\u0026rsquo;re going to build a map now; in sublime text make a new file and save it as index.html in the web-map folder. We\u0026rsquo;ll begin by putting some important information about the building blocks we\u0026rsquo;ll use in the \u0026lsquo;header\u0026rsquo; of our file, between the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;\\head\u0026gt; tags. Copy and paste the following into your index.html:  \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;A Demo WebMap\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026quot;utf-8\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta name=\u0026quot;viewport\u0026quot; content=\u0026quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.6.0/dist/leaflet.css\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026quot;https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.6.0/dist/leaflet.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script type=\u0026quot;text/javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; This is telling the browser the name of this page, and it\u0026rsquo;s telling the browser where to get the stylesheet and the code for making the map work. You don\u0026rsquo;t have the leaflet.css or the leaflet.js files yet. Right-click, and \u0026lsquo;save as\u0026rsquo; copies of these two files into your web-map folder from here: leaflet.css and leaflet.js\nThe next bit of code defines the base map:  \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;mapid\u0026quot; style=\u0026quot;width: 600px; height: 400px;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script type=\u0026quot;text/javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt; var myMap = L.map('mapid').setView([45.4192857, -75.6973237],13); L.tileLayer('https://stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/toner/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {maxZoom: 19 }).addTo(myMap); We\u0026rsquo;re creating a box on the page called \u0026lsquo;mapid\u0026rsquo; and setting its width and height in pixels. Then our script creates a thing called \u0026lsquo;mymap\u0026rsquo; and defines some particulars about it: the center of the map (here, Ottawa, Ontario), the zoom level, and the basemap layer. The final bit, addTo(mymap); does the work of putting all of that information on the map (using leaflet.js).\nNow we\u0026rsquo;re going to need some data for our map. Our point data will be encoded in a format called \u0026lsquo;geojson\u0026rsquo;, which is a kind of list. If you have geographic data in a csv table, with latitude and longitude columns, you could use this tool to convert it to geojson. For now, our geojson has two points in it:  { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;FeatureCollection\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Feature\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;geometry\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Point\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;coordinates\u0026quot;: [-75.6973237, 45.4192857] }, \u0026quot;properties\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Label\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Centre of our map!\u0026quot; } }, { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Feature\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;geometry\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Point\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;coordinates\u0026quot;: [ -75.699222, 45.4275 ] }, \u0026quot;properties\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Label\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Not the centre of the map \u0026quot; } } ] } Copy that into a new file and save in your web-map folder as point-data.geojson . (When you try to build a map of your graveyard, do you see how you could add your own point data with the csv-to-geojson tool?)\nNow append the following to the index.html, which will tell leaflet where the data is and how to add it to our map:  // load a GeoJSON from external file $.getJSON(\u0026quot;point-data.geojson\u0026quot;, function(data) { // add GeoJSON layer to the map once the file is loaded var datalayer = L.geoJson(data ,{ onEachFeature: function(feature, featureLayer) { featureLayer.bindPopup(feature.properties.Label); } }).addTo(myMap); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Save!\n At the command prompt, you\u0026rsquo;ll use python to start a webserver; the webserver acts like a regular server and makes these two files understandable by your web-browser: $ python -m http.server Please see the alert at the top of the page if you don\u0026rsquo;t have python on your machine; this is where you drag your work folder into prepos.\n  The terminal will tell you now that your server is running at an address that will look something like this: (http://0.0.0.0:8000/). Copy that full address and paste it into your browser\u0026rsquo;s address bar.\n  Congratulations! You have made a webmap! Do you see how you could recenter the map on Ottawa? Add some more data? Change the base map to another style?\n(You can upload your web-map folder to Github by dragging the folder onto a repository; to make Github serve your website, you create a new branch called gh-pages. So if I loaded it into github.com/shawngraham/demo/webmap in the gh-pages branch, my map will be available at shawngraham.github.io/demo/webmap/index.html. Cool, eh?)\nAdding a new layer to our map Map Warper is a service that allows us to upload images of maps, and then tie \u0026lsquo;control points\u0026rsquo; to real-world geography such that we stretch and warp the image to overlay the physical world. It then provides us with a tile-server so that the image can be imported into our map as its own layer. Take a look at this map of Ottawa:\nThis was uploaded to Mapwarper and georectified by a former MA student at Carleton. You can see it on Mapwarper at this location.\nIf you click on the \u0026lsquo;Export\u0026rsquo; tab, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that there\u0026rsquo;s a URL for the map as tiles: http://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/29435/{z}/{x}/{y}.png.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the line we want to add to our map.\n Open your index.html file. We\u0026rsquo;re going to add another layer, just after where you first specified your basemap, which to remind you, was at:  L.tileLayer('https://stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/toner/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {maxZoom: 19 }).addTo(myMap); Hit \u0026lsquo;enter\u0026rsquo; a few times after that final semicolon, and then paste in this:\nL.tileLayer('http://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/29435/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {maxZoom: 19} ).addTo(myMap); Save the file, and then in your browser reload the page (I\u0026rsquo;m assuming you still have the server running as per step 8 in the previous section). Boom!\nBut that map is a bit wonky, compared to our base map. Let\u0026rsquo;s find a new map from Library and Archives Canada, georectify it, and then swap it in. (When you build your own map of your graveyard, you may or may not be able to find an underlying historical map. That\u0026rsquo;s ok; if you can, great; if not, no worries.)\nGeorectifying a base map But as historians, we are often interested to show some process taking place in the past, so historical maps can be rhetorically extremely useful as base maps. But, to get such a map into a digital format that we can use, we need to georectify it.\nGeorectifying is the process of taking an image (whether it is of a historical map, chart, airphoto, or whatever) and manipulating its geometry so that it matches a geographic projection. Think of it like this: you take your handdrawn map, and use pushpins to pin down known locations on your map to a globe. As you pin, your image stretches and warps. Traditionally, this has not been an easy thing to do, if you are new to GIS. In recent years, the curve has flattened significantly. In this exercise, we\u0026rsquo;ll grab an image, upload it to the Map Warper website, and then export it as a tileset which can be used in other mapping programs.\nAt Library and Archives Canada I found an \u0026ldquo;Insurance Plan of Ottawa, June 1878\u0026rdquo; MIKAN 3824226.\nThis one in particular shows Parliament Hill. I will save this one to my machine and georectify it. You grab one that interests you!\n  Go to Map Warper and sign up for an account. Then login.\n  Go to the upload screen:\n  Fill in as much of the metadata as you can - it\u0026rsquo;s important to credit the material correctly! Then select your map from your computer, and upload it.\n  On the next page, click \u0026lsquo;Rectify\u0026rsquo;.\n  Pan and zoom both maps until you\u0026rsquo;re sure you\u0026rsquo;re looking at the same area in both. Double click in a map, select the location icon, and click on a point (location) you are sure you can match in the other window.\n  Click on the other map window, select the location icon, and then click on the same point.\n  Note the \u0026lsquo;Add control point\u0026rsquo; button below and between both maps will light up. Click on this to confirm that this is a control point you want. Do this at least three times; the more times you can do it, the better the map warp.\n  Having selected your control points, click on \u0026lsquo;Warp image\u0026rsquo;.\n  You can now click on the \u0026lsquo;Export\u0026rsquo; panel, and get the URL for your georectified image in a few different formats. Copy the tiles based URL and put that URL into your index.html file as you did in the previous section.\n  Adding a layer control button You can see that with leaflet it is pretty easy to add more layers and more data to your map. But soon things get a little bit unwieldy. We\u0026rsquo;re going to re-organize our map so that we can turn layers on and off.\nThe end result will look like this:\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create some variables to hold our different layers and maps. Make a copy of your index.html file and call it index2.html. Open index2.html in Sublime Text and work on that file.\n Delete the code from the var myMap = line to the // load a GeoJSON from external file.

Two are going to be base maps from Stamen (the \u0026lsquo;toner\u0026rsquo; map and the \u0026lsquo;watercolor\u0026rsquo; map), and two are going to be georectified maps we found on MapWarper showing downtown Ottawa. Insert after the \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag:\nvar toner = L.tileLayer('https://stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/toner/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'), watercolor = L.tileLayer('https://stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/watercolor/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'), historical1897 = L.tileLayer('https://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/29435/{z}/{x}/{y}.png'), lumberdistrict = L.tileLayer('https://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/27671/{z}/{x}/{y}.png') The L.tileLayer tells leaflet the sources for our layers.\nNow we\u0026rsquo;re going to create two more variables to group our layers into base maps and overlay maps:\nvar baseMaps = { \u0026quot;Toner\u0026quot;: toner, \u0026quot;Watercolor\u0026quot;: watercolor }; var overlayMaps = { \u0026quot;1897\u0026quot;: historical1897, \u0026quot;Lumber District\u0026quot;: lumberdistrict } Next, we create a variable called myMap to tell Leaflet the centre of our map, the zoom layer, and the default base map; we pass this information to the html container \u0026lsquo;mapid\u0026rsquo; so that our creation can be displayed:\nvar myMap = L.map('mapid', { center: [45.4192857, -75.6973237], zoom: 13, layers:[toner] }); and finally, we add a control box so that we can switch the different layers on and off, and that our layers are grouped appropriately:\nL.control.layers(baseMaps, overlayMaps).addTo(myMap); Save that as index2.html, and with your server still running, you can view it in your browser at http://localhost:8000/index2.html. (NB: the part after the colon might be different on your machine - this number is the \u0026lsquo;port\u0026rsquo; and the precise port number will have printed out in your terminal when you first ran the python -m http.server command.)\nFor more on layers with leaflet, see Layer Groups and Layers Control.\nThe Graveyard Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve seen how to build a map and serve it online, let\u0026rsquo;s modify it to show the graveyard you worked on.\n You\u0026rsquo;ll want the map to be centred on the graveyard you worked on, so you need to figure out the coordinates for it. These will go in the code for the variable myMap, and are in decimal degrees. Coordinates for your stones go in the geojson file. Easiest way to do this might be to make a csv table like so, in a text editor like Sublime Text:  latitude,longitude,geometry,Label 45.4192857,-75.6973237,Point,Centre of our map! 45.4275,-75.699222,Point,Not the centre of the map and then use this tool to convert it to geojson.\n You can try to find a historical map for an underlay, but only if you\u0026rsquo;re feeling keen.

Notice the inflection points? What was going on in the world at those points? (Remember there\u0026rsquo;s a lag between work being done, and work being published). What other patterns do you notice? Are there topics that perhaps relate to the themes of this course? In what journals? By what authors? World Archaeology tries to be a much more \u0026hellip;global\u0026hellip; journal.

(You can read the preprint here).\nOf course, this depends on archaeologists publishing both the code and the underlying data for their work, something that is unfortunately still comparatively rare. When the results of archaeological research can\u0026rsquo;t be replicated or examined, there is an argument to be made that the research is unethical.\nIn this exercise, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at one student\u0026rsquo;s attempt at replicating research done by Marwick.

If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation. Introduction This week, I am asking you to go out into your community and find a historic graveyard to work on. There was a graveyard in the middle of a field not far from the childhood home of a friend of mine. Who owned it? Who was responsible for it? Whose field was it in? Today, that field has been built over, with a couple of big box stores and a Tim Horton\u0026rsquo;s. The graveyard is still there, around back behind some dumpsters. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly overgrown, but periodically somebody hacks back some of the brush and picks up the garbage. Near where I live now, there is a historic graveyard in a corner of a city park, and the city keeps it clean and mows the lawn.\nBoth of these graveyards should be studied, but one of these is a safer place to work than the other.\nPersonal Safety \u0026gt; Course Work The first thing to keep in mind is that your personal safety is more important than course work. I have an alternative project for cases where it is either not safe or not feasible for you to go out to a historic (or currently active) graveyard. Just follow the instructions for the alternative project Things to consider This means that you will have to consider a number of elements before you go out:\n Can I actually get to the graveyard? Is it possible to work out who is responsible for the graveyard? If I see a graveyard called \u0026lsquo;Anytown United Cemetery\u0026rsquo; then I would look for the Anytown United Church and contact its office. Similarly for the Anytown Roman Catholic or the Anytown Free Methodist and so on. Small historic graveyards are often family cemeteries, and might be in a field or parcel of land belonging to the family. Or it might belong to someone else. You can explore historical land registry books (the link is for the City of Ottawa, but you can switch that) to find out the older history of the site. Obtain permission to survey the graveyard; speak to an individual rather than writing (you\u0026rsquo;ll get a quicker response). Use this form of words:   I would like to ask for permission to do a study of the grave monuments in [name of cemetery], as part of my coursework. This would involve photographing and measuring the stones. I will not be interfering with the stones or any of the planting or landscape. I believe it should not take me more than three or four days. The information I collect will be used in my class and ideally will be online if you agree. I can put you in contact with my Professor, Dr. Shawn Graham, if you have any questions about that aspect of the work.\n If you can\u0026rsquo;t find the owner (or if permission isn\u0026rsquo;t implied, as in the case of the graveyard in the public park mentioned above), or they decline your request, then do not survey that particular graveyard.\nConducting the Survey: Personal Safety  Do not go alone; take a companion Let people know where you are going, and when, and when you believe you will return Take a cellphone with you Bring water Wear sunscreen Wear appropriate clothing for a graveyard. Appropriate means \u0026lsquo;suitable to the task\u0026rsquo;; if the graveyard is overgrown, wear long pants and socks (ticks are a very real issue in Ontario). Similarly, if the graveyard is still active, there may well be mourners present and so be respectful. You represent the University. Conduct yourself accordingly. Do not sit on gravestones, put your lunch on a stone, or otherwise interfere with a grave.  Conducting the Survey Itself For instructions on how to conduct the survey itself, please begin by sketching the plan of the graveyard, and then how to record the graves\nSafety Online in the Case of Virtual Sites If you do the alternative project and the site you select features opportunities for online interactions, please take care; if it\u0026rsquo;s possible, create a character or use an account unrelated to your other online activities. Don\u0026rsquo;t engage with other players: ideally you want to be an observer in the space, rather than an active participant.\n","description":"instructions","id":29,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Working Safely","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/2/safework/"},{"content":"Please do not feel that you have to do this on your own. In the binder that you will load up, there is a feature to start a video chat from within the binder. Make use of that! When you click on it, it\u0026rsquo;ll give you a code. Share that with people in this class (or friends outside the class who might be able to help). If someone does help you, just add their name to the appropriate spot in the document that will result from this exercise. Collaboration is not a problem as long as you acknowledge it.\nIntroduction Archaeology - more than most disciplines - has problems with reproducibility, in the sense that many of our methods are inherently destructive. To excavate is to destroy. But it is also an act of creation, as I hope you\u0026rsquo;ve started to realize - the data that we record, the metadata that describes the nature of that data, the paradata that describes the contexts of our work and how that affects what it is we are able to see and record.\nA few years ago, I was a co-signer on a manifesto for open science in archaeology, led by Ben Marwick. Consider this figure from that article:\nMost of what we - as academics, as students - write is \u0026lsquo;advertising\u0026rsquo; for the research. How can we reproduce someone\u0026rsquo;s methods on a new body of material, if we can\u0026rsquo;t see the original code or data transformations? (And imagine trying to write a guide to data work in excel - \u0026lsquo;click on this thing, then that thing, oh your version of excel is different, ok, where is it\u0026rsquo;.) How can we replicate someone\u0026rsquo;s results to see if they got it right, if we can\u0026rsquo;t access the untransformed data?\nScholars such as Marwick have invested considerable scholarly effort in developing infrastructure and templates to address these shortcomings.\nRrtools Marwick created a special package for R called \u0026lsquo;rrtools\u0026rsquo; to make it easier for scholars and students to create reproducible packages for their research. When a user runs it, it creates all of the necessary folders and templates - analsysis, data, transformed data, and an rmarkdown file that can be a template for a journal article, mixing the analytical code and results right in with the text. (In advanced usage, it even copies the state of the machine and all installed packages so that a person can replicate everything about the analysis). The result can be copied or zipped up and deposited in a digital archive to support a journal or assignment. Some journals in fact require that data and code be made available as a condition of publishing; rrtools systematizes this.\nR Markdown\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve been using markdown in your own repositories to add simple semantics to your text files - ## for a second level header and so on. R markdown is a version of markdown that lets you mix in R code that R will run as it turns your text file into a word document. Code gets set off like this:\nNote the narrative written around the acutal code.\nWhen you tell R Studio that a file is in r markdown (it understands the file extension .rmd as rmarkdown), a new button appears labelled knit. If you click on that, R Studio will run your document through a template to turn it into (in this case a Word doc) and will also run all of the code and print the results into the document. If there are errors in the code, it will stop, and you have to fix them, then try again.\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll do You will launch this binder: http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/o-date/r-conda/master.\nThat will take you to the virtual computer running jupyter and R. Under the \u0026lsquo;New\u0026rsquo; button at right, select \u0026lsquo;R Studio\u0026rsquo;. Start a new script.\nCopy this R script to your environment and work through it; it will install rrtools for you, and coach you through making your own research compendium. The data that you will use will be our aggregated graveyard survey data; there\u0026rsquo;s code in that file to copy the data to your compendium. In your rmarkdown file, I want you to do at least one exploratory statistic and one visualization. More of course would be awesome, but let\u0026rsquo;s aim for one, for now.\nMake sure to save your work, and to zip it up and download it from the binder. I cannot stress this enough. If you walk away from your computer and leave it idle for around ten minutes you will lose your work. Save early, save often, zip, and download.\nThen, put the zip file and the resulting Word doc in your own github repo for this week.\nReady? Go!\n","description":"Your own reproducible research","id":30,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"A Research Compendium of One's Own","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/10/start-compendium/"},{"content":"Before you head out to the graveyard that you intend to record, I want you to make a sketchmap to bring with you.\nWhile the digital recording system that we are using can read the geolocation of your device when you are standing at a stone, the accuracy of that location might not be enough for us to understand any spatial patterns that might exist. While testing the system in a local graveyard, I found that stones a few feet apart would show up on the map (using my cellphone\u0026rsquo;s geolocation) hundreds of feet apart. It\u0026rsquo;s not very good resolution.\nNormally, in archaeology, extremely careful surveying is done so that everything that is recorded or recovered has a precise location in three dimensional space, keyed in to larger systems of spatial organization. For obvious reasons, we can\u0026rsquo;t do that.\nInstead, I want you to begin by making a sketch map of the graveyard. You might want to try using Google Earth Pro to see if you can find your graveyard; if you can, print out a screenshot and use that as the basis for your sketchmap and developing your recording scheme. It might be that where you live there is sufficient demand for high-resolution imagery that you can even make out individual stones. Where I live, that\u0026rsquo;s not the case.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a screenshot from Google Maps of a cemetery in a park in the Riverside South part of Ottawa:\nI have a simple paint program on my computer, and I used it to create this:\nI could print that out on a single sheet of paper, and use that to indicate the various graves, which I would then number. - MCOO for the cemetery (Moodie Cemetery Ottawa Ontario), and mcoo-01, mcoo-02 for the graves. I could add more details as I found them - stones that aren\u0026rsquo;t visible in the satellite image, for instance.\nThe cemetery is surrounded by an ornamental fence. I could measure that, and indicate the lengths on this map. I could measure in from two sides to each stone, so that I know the distance and positioning of each stone.\nIf you number the stones on your sketch, then you can be sure you don\u0026rsquo;t miss any, and should someone else make use of your data, they will know which stones you are referring to.\nIf satellite imagery isn\u0026rsquo;t available, you could go to the graveyard, and simply sketch the terrain - indicate major features of the landscape, falls in the land, landmarks unlikely to change. Take measurements so that the position of the stones can be unambiguous.\nThe sketchmap is a tool to use when you\u0026rsquo;re out at the graveyard. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be pretty. Feel free to take a quick snap of your sketchmap and share it in Discord. (Also, make sure to put it in your repo for this week too.)\n(Later, you\u0026rsquo;ll try to make a digital map from your sketchmap. You might be able to work out coordinates for your stones between what your phone\u0026rsquo;s geolocation says, and what you can deduce from looking at Google Earth or Google Maps).\n","description":"Sketchmaps Do Hard Work","id":31,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Making a Sketch Map of Your Site","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/2/sketchmap/"},{"content":"Consolidation Pause II Goals for this week  Use this time to catch up on anything you didn\u0026rsquo;t read, to try some of the exercises over again, and to consolidate what you\u0026rsquo;ve achieved so far.

Ask a family member or other person in your \u0026lsquo;bubble\u0026rsquo; to go along with you.\nThis project is inspired by the DEBS: Discovering England\u0026rsquo;s Burial Spaces project.\nInstructions   Locate a local graveyard - historic or otherwise - and obtain permission to study the stones. A cemetery currently being used is probably the easiest place to work, as people are expected to be present, whereas historic graveyards might be on private land.\n  Devise a short id code for the graveyard. Archaeological sites in Canada are enumerated using a \u0026lsquo;Borden number\u0026rsquo; based roughly on the latitude and longitude of the site. We won\u0026rsquo;t use a Borden number (it\u0026rsquo;s entirely possible of course that a graveyard might actually have a Borden number if it was ever excavated or added to an inventory). For our purposes, devise a 4 letter code that abbreviates the common name for the graveyard. Eg., Norway Bay United Cemetery could be nwuc.\n  Follow the instructions on making a quick sketchmap to sketch out the portion of the graveyard (or the whole thing, if it\u0026rsquo;s not too big) that you are working in. Number each grave with a sequential series of numbers that incorporate the graveyard id code, eg nwuc-01, nwuc-02, etc.\n  We’ll use this scheme - http://debs.ac.uk/files/CodeSheets.pdf - to codify our observations for entry into our recording system. I would suggest that you print it out, staple it together, and bring it with you.\n  The numbering system builds up to describe a stone, monument, or tomb. For instance, in the illustration below, 1126, each digit is significant. The first 1 indicates chest and table tombs, the next two digits differentiate between chest tomb with plain sides (11) and chest tomb with rectangular panelled sides, 12, and then the final digit describes the decoration on the top, 6, what is called a double bale. Headstones begin with 4 and the combination of digits can be used to describe quite complex shapes and motifs.\nThen, record the stone \u0026amp; the inscription with this: https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/uIGvnNmd. It works best with Chrome. Deciding precisely which numbers best describe what you are observing will be a challenge. As you work, make a note of problems you encounter with the scheme - what assumptions are literally encoded that do not seem to reflect what you are seeing? Are there shapes that just don\u0026rsquo;t seem to fit?  Before you go out to the graveyard These forms can be used for off-line data recording. Open the link on a smartphone or tablet when you are connected to wifi or data. On the top right of most mobile browsers, there\u0026rsquo;s a button you can click for options; one of these will be \u0026lsquo;add to home screen\u0026rsquo;  You fill in as many of the fields as possible, but make sure to always add the ID for the graveyard and for the stone in question. The location field will try to automatically get your location from your device; the plus-minus on this can be quite variable. Do take a photograph (there is a field that will do that). When you press the submit button at the bottom of the form, the results will be queued and saved locally in your device, and then you can record the next stone. Once you turn data on or are back in wifi range, your results will upload automatically to the server.\n  You can record the personal information on the stones with this form, which works in the exact same way: https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/vFoK4DMY\n  I am imagining that recording between 5 and 10 stones will be feasible for you to do over the course of this week and next.\nYour data will upload to a server that I have access to, and be collated with the work of everyone else in the class.

If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation. Introduction Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. \u0026lsquo;Git\u0026rsquo; is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state. It also allows you to create branches, or duplicates of your folder, so you can experiment. If you like the results of your work, you can merge that branch back into your original.\nGithub therefore is a hub for sharing these git snapshots.\nA branch (a copy, a duplicate) of your work uploaded to Github could therefore be copied to say my account (a fork); then I might download to my machine to work on it (I\u0026rsquo;ve pulled it). Once I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my changes, I commit them (save them to the sequence of changes that Git tracks), and then I could push those changes to the fork in my account. I would then send you a pull request or notification, asking you to pull my changes back to your account; you could then decide whether or not to merge.\nFor our purposes, you will use Github mostly as a place to put your reflections or other pieces of work. I might sometimes fork your work, pull it down onto my machine, make changes that I commit, push it back online, and ask you to pull the changes back. But that won\u0026rsquo;t happen very often. It takes a while to get comfortable with this.\nGet your account  Got to github.com and sign up for an account. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to use your real name. (Protip: You might want to set up an email just for signing up for things.)  Verify your account.  Select the free tier (nb: I will never require you to pay for any reading, or any software. If something wants you to pay, stop and ask for help).  Skip telling Github anything about yourself.  Do the verification email thing. Once you hit the verification link in your email, you\u0026rsquo;ll be brought back to Github to make a new repository:  Give it a reasonable name; tick the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme\u0026rsquo; box, tick off the \u0026lsquo;private\u0026rsquo; box, and hit the green commit button:  And on the final page, hit the \u0026lsquo;dismiss\u0026rsquo; button in the \u0026lsquo;Github Actions box\u0026rsquo;  Ta Da! You now have a github account, and you\u0026rsquo;ve created your first repository. Going Forward create a new repository for each week\u0026rsquo;s work/reflection. You can create a new repository from the plus sign in the top right corner:\nnb Remember to tick off the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme.md\u0026rsquo; file.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, you\u0026rsquo;ll be at your Github user page:\nAdd me as a collaborator to this and subsequent private repositories:   Then, once you\u0026rsquo;ve clicked on \u0026lsquo;manage access\u0026rsquo;, click on \u0026lsquo;invite collaborator\u0026rsquo;,\n  Then find my username shawngraham, and add me:\n  Setting up a \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; for your work A \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; is just a folder that you\u0026rsquo;ve shared on Github. There are two ways to do this; the easy way and the more complex way. Luck you, you have already done the easy way - you selected the initialize with a readme, and it\u0026rsquo;s already present in your browser!\nTo create new repositories, just click on the + button on the top right of your Github page when you\u0026rsquo;re logged in. You might want to go ahead now and create repositories for week 2 through to week 12. Remember to tick off the initialize with a readme box. Remember to make them private. But if you didn\u0026rsquo;t tick the initialize box, you\u0026rsquo;ve embarked on the more complex way. In the screenshot below, I created a new repository but I forgot to initialize it, and now I\u0026rsquo;m looking at this page:\nIf this is you, do not despair.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten to initialize a new repo:  If you have a PC, click on this link to download and install git. Make a new directory on your computer with the same name as the repo you created above. In my example, that would be week-two. On a PC, right-click on the folder and select \u0026lsquo;open a command prompt here\u0026rsquo;. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, select Keyboard \u0026gt; Shortcuts \u0026gt; Services. Look for \u0026lsquo;New Terminal at Folder\u0026rsquo; and tick the box. Open your finder; find the folder you created, right-click and select \u0026lsquo;open Terminal here\u0026rsquo;. Do you see where, in your browser at github, it says ...or create a new repository on the command line? Type in each line exactly as it is there (beginning with echo), hitting enter at the end of each line, in order. If the command works, you\u0026rsquo;ll just be presented with the next prompt. The computer only ever responds when there is output to print - which often means only when there is an error message to report.  Ta da! You can now go to github.com\\\u0026lt;your-user-name\u0026gt;\\your-repo and you\u0026rsquo;ll see it all there tickety boo.\nMaking a new text file on Github You can make a new text file by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;create new file\u0026rsquo; button; remember to always use .md as the file extension. You can specify headers, links, images, bullets, blockquotes and so on by using markdown conventions\nThe two videos below might be a bit clearer on youtube itself.\n  Uploading a file into Github You can add new files from your computer by dragging and dropping them into the main repository. At the end of this video, I show you how to display the image in the text of the reflection.\n  Going further Github can also be used to run an entire website, generated from your text files. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s how I built this course website! The following three links are from my HIST4806a 2020 seminar on digital history and museums; they will walk you through how to use your Github account to serve up a professional scholarly website; you can use this scholarly website to host your reflections and course work, if you want.

I\u0026rsquo;m asking you to start with the easier ones, and then push yourself to try the others. Spatial archaeology looks at the patterning of the remains of human activity in (usually geographic) space over time. It can encompass working with geographic information systems, and it can encompass web mapping (on which see ODATE 3.5). A geographic information system is a way of stacking a series of maps of the same region that contain different kinds of information. Perhaps one layer is a map of soils. Another might be information on slope (steepness) or aspect (direction the slope faces). Another layer might have information on the relative fertility of the soil. To this stack we might add distribution maps of human activity for a given period (perhaps scatters of pottery). The power of GIS lies in its ability to query the ways these different layers might intersect. How does human activity 3000 years ago in the area intersect with the fertility of the soil, and the aspect of the hills? Is there a preference for one kind of landscape rather than another? If we imagine people stood 1.8 m tall, and there\u0026rsquo;s no vegetation in the way, what might they have been able to see?\nBurials at Linlithgow (Python) Dr. Rachel Optiz is a digital archaeologist and landscape archaeologist at the University of Glasgow. She has made a series of computational notebooks for her Archaeology of Scotland class exploring some of the ways we might query spatial data and maps in the Python programming language. Right-click on the link below to launch her binder:\nhttps://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ropitz/spatialarchaeology/master\nAnd then select the linlithgow_spatial.ipynb file, and work through that. (Remember, you select the first cell in the document, then hit run. Wait for it to finish - it\u0026rsquo;ll have an * in it when running, replacing with a sequential number when finished). This notebook explores looking at spatial relationships at a small scale - within a group of Medieval burials from the Carmelite Monastery at Linlithgow.\nYou might get an error towards the end to the effect that something called descartes is not installed. To fix this, click the + to create a new cell. Then, put the following code in the cell:\n!pip install descartes\nand then hit the run button.\n It is possible to just continue without correcting that one particular error.\nBut now, let\u0026rsquo;s turn to a bit larger scale. While the previous work was done in the Python language, this next one will use R.\nExploring a landscape (R). Daniel Contreras has a chapter in Ben Marwick\u0026rsquo;s online book, \u0026lsquo;How To do Archaeological Science in R\u0026rsquo; about using R as a GIS. We\u0026rsquo;re going to follow along with that chapter, but I have modified the code slightly so that it will run in a virtual computer in your browser, using the coding environment R Studio and the language R.\n  Launch a virtual computer running RStudio in your browser by right-clicking on this link\n  The interface for RStudio looks like this:\n  Create a new script:  The dem-gis.R script that you want can be found at this link. Open the link in a new tab, and then copy it into the script window in R Studio. Put the cursor at the top of the file at the start of the line. You can then run each line by hitting the \u0026lsquo;run\u0026rsquo; button, or by using the keyboard shortcut (cmd+enter or shift+enter). Read the comments (which are marked with a # sign) and follow all instructions.  Work your way through Contreras\u0026rsquo; tutorial, using the dem-gis.R code.\nNow, the advantages to using R or Python to do this kind of work lies in the idea of reproducibility. You can see every step in the reshaping of the data, in the filtering and layering.\nMany archaeologists use the open source QGIS program to work with their data, which provides a visual graphical user interface. It\u0026rsquo;s a very powerful piece of software, and does allow scripting and other interactions. The problem with software-via-a-GUI is that it becomes very hard to reproduce exactly the sequences of clicks and so on that a person uses. Nevertheless, if mapping intrigues you, you should play with it. An excellent guide, \u0026lsquo;QGIS for Archaeologists - Getting Started\u0026rsquo; in the BAJR Practical Guide Series by Jake Streatfeild-James (2016) is at http://www.bajr.org/BAJRGuides/42_QGIS_StarterGuide/42_BAJR_Guide_QGIS.pdf. (By the way, many archaeologists use commercial projects from Esri to handle their spatial data; if you find data files ending with .shp, a \u0026lsquo;shape file\u0026rsquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s an Esri readable format and indeed, the industry standard.)\nIf you really want to get into QGIS, then QGIS4Arch is for you, a series of videos [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqiB3IIUNAnU8vPcuea6A9pB7Y_qQBH1u] by Ed Gonzalez-Tennant.\n","description":"GIS and webmapping are a bit different","id":35,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Spatial Archaeology","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/3/spatial-archae/"},{"content":"   While watching this video, turn on the closed captions.\nCreate an account at hypothes.is:\nGet the Chrome app or the Firefox bookmarklet:\nMake sure you\u0026rsquo;re logged in:\nThen join our HIST3000|CLCV3000 reading group.

Using a system like Wordpress or Squarespace etc can leave you locked in to someone else\u0026rsquo;s platform (and any security issues that might entail).\nHere, we\u0026rsquo;re going to build a simple website that uses nothing but text files as its source; these text files will always be readable into the future, and you can also copy them to your own machine so that they\u0026rsquo;re always handy, ready to be transformed into something else.\nI\u0026rsquo;m talking about static site building; there are many different generators out there that will take your text files, pump them through some templates, and spit out flat html on the other side. At The Programming Historian, there is a lesson by Amanda Visconti on using Jekyll and Github Pages to make a site; we\u0026rsquo;re going to do something much easier.\nIn essence, you are going to create a new repository in your Github account called your-username.github.io and it will be set to public when you make it; initialize with a readme.md. Then, add a new file in there called index.md and you\u0026rsquo;re going to write something in that file, eg,\n## My Quick Static Site This is a site I build with gh-pages. **Wow** It reads [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and turns it into html. ![gif ftw](https://media.giphy.com/media/nXxOjZrbnbRxS/200w_d.gif) Commit that file. Then, hit the gear wheel icon (the settings) and scroll down to the Github Pages section. Github will run your text files through the Jekyll site builder for you; here you can select from some of their templates.\nBoom! The full process is on this site with screenshots.\nContent Now, consider how you want to explain your work so far in this course on the graveyard project. You might want to create some subpages; just make these in your repo as text files ending in .md. When Github builds your page, it will add these to the navigation. Put images in the same folder, and then you can link to them with ![al-text describing the image](image-filename.png) (or .jpg, right? Depends on the filename?).\nThe layout and so on is probably not going to be perfectly what you want. There will be time enough to fiddle with this, and there are any number of tutorials out there on customizing a gh-pages simple site. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about that right now. Think of your content first, for this week.\nGoing Further Now, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more to static websites than this. This course site is generated with Hugo; a site generator for building exhibitions, called \u0026lsquo;Wax\u0026rsquo;, is available here. (Speaking of exhibits, here\u0026rsquo;s information about building them with Omeka.net.)\n","description":"Building a fast and secure site","id":40,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Static Websites","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/10/static-websites/"},{"content":"\nHIST3000|CLCV3000 Fall 2020 Department of History, Carleton University Once the excavation is over, what happens to the information created through archaeological research? How do archaeologists use digital technologies on site, in the lab, or on the web? This course explores the intersection of digital technologies and computing with archaeology. We will explore the ways theory gets embedded into computation; perhaps there is even a theory of digital archaeology? We will explore how digital technologies allow us to ask questions that would otherwise be impossible to ask. We will consider the ethical ramifications of our digital tools and opaque algorithms. We will also look into the ways that computational creativity in archaeology allow for novel engagements with the past, thus moving us into a digital public archaeology.\nYou do not need to be \u0026lsquo;techy\u0026rsquo; to be successful in this course! You just need to be diligent, honest, and open. You will read, watch, listen to, and discuss the class materials via various online tools including Hypothes.is and Github (Speaking of Hypothes.is, highlight a word on this page and see what happens). We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead. Successful completion of this class involves doing a series of exercises each week designed to push you out of your comfort zone, AND to be a collegial and generous scholar engaging with, and helping your peers to achieve success. What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go. Thus open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked, is a meaningful aspect of this course. Again: You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.\nThe Most Important Idea Archaeology\u0026rsquo;s genesis was in racism, and colonialism.\nDigital technology\u0026rsquo;s birth was in the violence of war, and the control of systems.\nIf you put those two things together without taking into account the implications then we\u0026rsquo;re in for a lot of trouble.\nSo what I want to know is, can digital archaeology be taught, be learned, be practiced, in such a way that we unpick those two trajectories, those two monstrous births, and use digital archaeology to better understand communities, empower people, and give better, more compelling, more truthful stories about what it means to be human?\nArchaeology isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily about the past. It\u0026rsquo;s about the materiality of the past and present and in many ways, the future. We try to understand what it is to be human through the extended abilities that tool use, that objects and their agencies, give to us. The digital tools we use and are entangled with extend humanity in powerful ways - and in 2020, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see how digital technologies have extended humanity\u0026rsquo;s worst impulses.\nMy goal here is to teach you to use certain digital techs; to unpack and interrogate those techs you learn to use; and to equip you to use these things in a reflective manner. It\u0026rsquo;s about archaeology using computation; but also, looking at computation from an archaeological perspective. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be uncomfortable. Not only that, this is the first iteration of the course. That makes you my accomplices. There will be things we try here that will not work. That\u0026rsquo;s why part of the exit ticket for this course will be for you to rethink the one part of the course that was most affecting for you to make it better, but also, to think through who it might harm.\nText/Tech To the best of my ability, all materials will either be open access materials on the web or materials made available to us through MacOdrum Library or the University. You will not be required to purchase any set text or software.\nWe will be using elements of the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook Environment https://o-date.github.io; we may in fact re-write parts of it as a result of our work, in which case you will be credited as a co-author.\nHaving a reasonably up-to-date computer will make life easier for you; if you use a chromebook or a low-powered laptop (eg, less than 8 gb of RAM), this will require us to think creatively about some of the work, but should not present an insurmountable obstacle. A good internet connection will make life easier, but I realize that not everyone is well-served by our tech oligopolies. Please let me know if these situations apply to you so that we can work out a suitable plan of action.\nClass format This class will be delivered online, asynchronously. A Discord server will be used to provide a social context to our work, for help, and for collaboration. Learning materials will be curated on this open course website, and might include a variety of modalities. There will be no required synchronous chats or lectures. Students will maintain course research notebooks on the web (which may be anonymous or pseudonymous or made private provided access is shared with me).\nWhy? I\u0026rsquo;ve taught online for a variety of institutions, using a variety of formats and approaches. I like teaching asnchronously because I believe it is a kinder approach to complex topics, especially when there is a second layer of difficulty - basic digital literacy, in this case - which intersects with the content, my learning goals for you, your own personal situations - in ways I cannot always anticipate or know.\nSince I cannot know these things, I do not believe that I should bludgeon you with content; I do not think that \u0026lsquo;rigour\u0026rsquo; is demonstrated by forcing you to join me at set times; I do not believe that face-to-face work is somehow more \u0026lsquo;scholarly\u0026rsquo; than other kinds of work. Right now, with the world the way it is, I want to build a structure that opens possibility space for you to engage with this topic, and with \u0026lsquo;digital archaeology\u0026rsquo; when you encounter it beyond this course, in ways that will push you forward as a scholar and citizen.\nFor this to work well, it requires you to be on the same page as me. There is a lot of flexibility built into this course, but it does require you to try to push yourself out of your comfort zone. The key thing is always to tie what you\u0026rsquo;re doing with what you\u0026rsquo;re reading and what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking. That \u0026lsquo;second layer of difficulty\u0026rsquo; will come with practice. But how it intersects with everything else: that\u0026rsquo;s where the learning happens.\nIt might seem a bit macabre or \u0026lsquo;off\u0026rsquo; somehow to build some of our work around the ways the dead are memorialized in Canadian graveyards, in this time of pandemic (see week two). I wrestled with this. But I settled on doing this for a variety of reasons. One, the simple reason that getting you outside and doing one variety of archaeological work and thinking through how tech intersects with field work and the realities of space is a valuable exercise; two it gives us data that we can work on later as the weather grows colder; and more importantly - three - we don\u0026rsquo;t often talk about death in modern Western culture. Memorialization and its practices can reveal much about past human groups, but in the gaps with our present day, can teach us much about ourselves.\n\u0026hellip;and that is why this course is the way it is. No doubt, things will break, and some things will work better/be more effective than others. We will roll with it.\n","description":"what to tell your friends","id":41,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"1.

Sometimes -and we\u0026rsquo;re expecting this, you and I- things won\u0026rsquo;t work as we expect; tech might break; the world might impinge too much. We will adapt accordingly. Remember: the grade in this course is a function of your process and your evolution, so adapting and thinking through the implications of when things don\u0026rsquo;t go according to plan is, in fact, according to plan. Outcomes  Situate the emergence and evolution of digital archaeology within the historiography of archaeology more broadly Implement and contribute to a digital archaeology gravestones\u0026rsquo; and monuments survey Investigate data, artifacts, and primary sources, using the methods/techniques/perspectives of digital archaeology and digital humanities Develop online experiences that communicate the results of these investigations as an act of public digital archaeology Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently. However, no one operates in a vacuum; digital archaeologists collaborate to troubleshoot or develop technologies, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others’ work in a collaborative fashion.  Texts See the weekly work section. All readings are open access.\nReal Names Policy You do not need to use your real name or identity on any public-facing work that you do in this course. Nor do you need to explain to me that you wish to use a pseudonym. It is sufficient that you send an email to me with the following message:\n‘I would like to use the following username in all public-facing work: xxxxxxxx’\n…where xxxxx is the name you have selected. For safety’s sake, if you decide to use a pseudonym, do not use one that you have used on any other website or social media platform.\nWhen Life Intervenes There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, in this class. That said, I can\u0026rsquo;t help you if I don\u0026rsquo;t know you need help, a breathing space, some direction. When something comes up, just let me know:\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something has intervened. I trust you.\r When something comes up and this course has to move to the backburner, contact me and we can figure out something else to do, or something else that will help you be successful here. It\u0026rsquo;s our course - we can change things up as we need to.\n","description":"what you'll get out of this course","id":42,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"2. Learning Outcomes","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/docs/2-learning-outcomes/"},{"content":"Each week involves completing to the best of your ability various exercises; you will document your progress in a weekly log that you will keep online. Log entries are required to be completed by the Sunday evening at the end of the relevant work. A final reflection piece is due at the end of the course. See the assessment page for further details.\nSome exercises are collaborative for the class as a whole. Some are individual. There will sometimes be a choice of exercise.\nAll work for a given module has to be completed and submitted before the next module begins. Late work cannot be accepted unless you obtain permission from Dr. Graham. Just talk with him, if something comes up.

Course Calendar","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/docs/3-schedule/"},{"content":"There is no midterm. There is no final exam.\r Weekly Work Each week, there are tasks for you to attempt. Sometimes there is a choice of which tasks to do; in those cases, I\u0026rsquo;m not looking for the number of these that you complete, but that you push yourself out of your comfort level. What\u0026rsquo;s more, it\u0026rsquo;s OK if something doesn\u0026rsquo;t work \u0026lsquo;perfectly.\u0026rsquo; The reflection on the process, both your fails and your successes, is the important thing.\nWeekly work should be completed and logged by the end of the relevant week. Dr Graham will provide ungraded feedback on this work in order to help you grow. There are three \u0026lsquo;consolidation\u0026rsquo; weeks in the schedule, where you\u0026rsquo;ll prepare a \u0026lsquo;consolidation document\u0026rsquo; that will be graded. Late work can be accepted only through arrangement with Dr. Graham.\nIf you miss a week, or something comes up let Dr. Graham know as soon as possible so that arrangements can be made. I want you to be successful; if something comes up we can adapt accordingly. If you do not let me know, then I cannot help you.\nEvidence for Your Weekly Logs (ungraded work) I am looking for the following kinds of evidence (each week will specify what needs to be done):\n logs/lab notebook entry that keep track of what you actually did reflection on that process engagement with the materials and your classmates (which might be demonstrated many different ways) evidence for your growth as a scholar over this course  At the end of each week by Sunday evening, you will provide to me through a form that can be found on each weekly page the links to your evidence for me to consider.\nI will return feedback to you within two or three days. I will write you a short note giving you my perspective on what you\u0026rsquo;ve done (using the lens of the learning outcomes), and offering advice. This weekly work is to help you grow. It is not formally assigned a grade, but it does provide evidence of your growth against the learning outcomes, and your engagement with it does play into your eventual final grade.\nConsolidation Weeks (graded work) Every fourth week (that is, at the end of each module) you will submit a \u0026lsquo;consolidation document\u0026rsquo;. Consolidation weeks give you the space to try something again, or finish doing something that you had to put aside earlier. This document is where you can show me that you\u0026rsquo;ve taken my feedback and considered it and adapted/adopted accordingly. These are short documents; they can reuse materials (suitably edited) from your journal and note entries. I would like you to suggest an overall grade for the module for you, based on how your work matches up against the learning outcomes for the course (see \u0026lsquo;grading\u0026rsquo; below).\n Module 1 consolidation document: due at the end of week four; may be submitted in the following week if you notify me in week four. Module 2 consolidation document: due at the end of week eight; may be submitted in the following week if you notify me in week eight. Module 3 consolidation document: due at the end of week twelve; may be submitted in the following week if you notify me in week twelve.  Do not attempt to speedrun this course. By \u0026lsquo;speedrun\u0026rsquo; I mean, you leave it until the end and try to do all of the work in one intense session. Work done in that fashion cannot, by virtue of it all being dumped in my lap at the end of the course, take into account feedback, peer collaboration, or have any meaningful engagement with the materials. Thus, work done in this fashion cannot meet the learning goals of the course, with negative implications for your grade. Do not do this. The Exit Ticket You will produce an \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; for me at the end of the course (open format) reflecting on where you started and where you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you\u0026rsquo;ve done against the learning outcomes. The exit ticket is a summary assessment exercise that will pull all the different strings together into a strong cord. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s journey is different. Digital methods are more a matter of practice and time than they are of aptitude.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never done digital work before, it might be that you never quite manage to get as many of the tech things working as you might\u0026rsquo;ve wanted: but you now know what you didn\u0026rsquo;t know before. That\u0026rsquo;s a win. You might be a computer science minor and the tech materials don\u0026rsquo;t present you with much challenge: but figuring out how to tell the compelling story was very difficult for you but you\u0026rsquo;re better at it now. Your \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; will explain to me your particular context, and it will point to the evidence that demonstrates how you\u0026rsquo;ve moved along from where you were at the beginning to where you are now.\nIf I agree with your assessment, then that is the grade you will receive (thus, you have the opportunity to override the percentage breakdowns below).\nWhen I have disagreed in previous courses this has been, 9.5 times out of 10, to raise the grade: y\u0026rsquo;all are too hard on yourselves. If I have disagreed and felt that you\u0026rsquo;ve overstated things - if you were the 0.5 out of 10 - we would talk and come to an agreement.\nThe Exit Ticket should be submitted within one week of the last day of the fall term.\nGrading Remembering the learning outcomes,\n   Learning Outcome A B C D eg. Jo Q Student     1. analytical ability - - - - X   2. methodology - - - - -   3. collaboration - - - - X   4. argumentation - - - - X   5. professionalization - - - - -    \u0026hellip;5/5 would be an A, 4/5 would be a B, 3/5 would be a C, 2/5 a D.\nIn this example, based on my consideration of Jo Q Student\u0026rsquo;s evidence and the feedback I\u0026rsquo;d written him over the six weeks, it seemed to me that he did what she needed to do (satisfactorily) for 3 out of the 5 outcomes and so earned a C. However, her exit ticket might bring her up. Percentage Breakdown I am required by the University to provide a percentage breakdown.\nConsolidation documents = 75%\nFinal Exit ticket = 25%\nI reserve the right to adjust those percentages to take into account the particular circumstances of the student.\n","description":"grading and ungrading","id":44,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"4.

Rather, I am trying to help you learn the skills that you will need to uncover whatever aspect of method and thought that will help you with your research goals. A big part of that is trying to teach how to deal with what might feel like \u0026lsquo;failure\u0026rsquo;, on first blush. I want you to swing for the bleachers, and not to be afraid of whiffing on the ball. After all, to mix sporting metaphors, you\u0026rsquo;re here for icetime not the Stanley Cup.\nOn another note, this course originally was intended to be a kind of hybrid course, blending face to face work in the classroom with resources and digital tools.\nThat of course, can\u0026rsquo;t happen at the moment.\nMoving online just means that I have to work harder at fostering the social aspect of learning and education.\nSocial Contact Another problem with moving fully online is isolation. Working with digital tools and environments, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re not overly familiar with how they work - or even the underlying metaphors that would help you make sense of what\u0026rsquo;s going on - is frustrating. Bad enough when you have classmates you see twice a week and can at least complain with over coffee later; extremely awful when you\u0026rsquo;re on a bad internet connection and everyone thinks that you\u0026rsquo;re not really doing schoolwork.\nIn past classes, I have used Slack as a way of trying to meet that need for human connection that makes learning meaningful. It worked, more or less, but if there was a conversation going on and you missed part of it, it could just feel overwhelming and impenetrable.\nAnd it was one more damned thing to install. One more damned thing to get a password for.\nI tried Zulipchat another year.

Instructions will seem vague or incomplete - or worse, I will have indeed forgotten to tell you something crucial.\nOr worse, I\u0026rsquo;ve made an assumption about your understanding, and left things unsaid that needed to be made explicit. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of this, in the digital world, in fact.\nThis week, you learned a bit about Git and Github. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at a question on the q-and-a site, \u0026lsquo;Stackoverflow\u0026rsquo; here. Just scroll through that question, and look at some of the answers. Make a note of any terms or code or responses that make not an ounce of sense to you.\nIt can make you feel rather overwhelmed, rather quickly. And like most places on the internet, StackOverflow has its own culture, its own norms of expression and behaviour. People who are new can get roasted. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons we have our own discord server, and a private reading group on Hypothesis: these are places for you to ask for help from a community that understands where you\u0026rsquo;re coming from because we\u0026rsquo;re all in the same headspace.\nSo, when things go wrong, the first thing to do is to find the community that understands where you\u0026rsquo;re coming from. I read and search StackOverflow all the time, but I rarely ask questions there. Instead, I write to trusted colleagues. And they in turn write to me.\nBut there are a couple of things we can do to make life easier.\nAsking good questions StackOverflow does have good advice on asking good questions. I will excerpt some of their advice:\n Write a title that summarizes the specific problem\u0026hellip; If you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble summarizing the problem, write the title last - sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.\n  Introduce the problem before you post any code [or a screenshot or a video clip]\u0026hellip;start by expanding on the summary you put in the title. Explain how you encountered the problem you\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself.\n  Help others reproduce the problem [SG: post the code, post a screenshot, post a video clip walk through]\n Please do this.\nEvery term, I receive dozens of emails with the subject line \u0026lsquo;help\u0026rsquo; and the message body \u0026lsquo;i tried it and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rsquo;. Sometimes, the message will also say \u0026lsquo;i worked on it for 3 hrs and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rsquo;.\nNone of that is helpful. Telling me that you worked on it for 3 hours just shows me that you ignored my messages about \u0026lsquo;if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come after 30 minutes, take a break, ask for help\u0026rsquo;.\nCollect all of the information together, put it in a file in your repo, and share the link in discord or post the whole thing in the relevant channel.\nPlease, PLEASE, don\u0026rsquo;t just post something that says, \u0026lsquo;it didn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rsquo; and then leave it at that. What\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;it\u0026rsquo;? What were you expecting to happen? What did you try? Show me\u0026hellip;\nAnswering questions As the course progresses, you will have many opportunities to ask for help from me and from your peers - post these in our discord server in the appropriate channel.\nSometimes, you will see questions that you can answer. A few guidelines for answering questions:\n There are many different ways to solve these issues; someone might post a different way but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that either of you are necessarily wrong. Read the question carefully. Request clarification if there are bits that the original poster didn\u0026rsquo;t make clear - help them to ask better questions. Use screenshots and screenvideo (I find screencastomatic handy in this regard) to show how things worked for you. Provide links to useful relevant material if you know of it. Assume the best of everyone: not everyone has the same fluency with these machines, and it takes a while to learn the language.  Answering the questions of your peers, helping them out, is an excellent way to meet one of the course outcomes.\n","description":"Good questions make life easier","id":50,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Asking for help","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/1/help/"},{"content":"Click title to see the full Post\nLorem est tota propiore conpellat pectoribus de\npectora summo.
