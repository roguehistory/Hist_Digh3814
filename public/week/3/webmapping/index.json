Jump into our social space and ask for advice.\r Record and Reflect   Being a digital archaeologist means keeping track of what you’ve done, as a gift to your future self (ie, so that when you come back to something, you can pick up where you left off). Make a new text document, and put into it any new terms you’ve encountered, commands you used, error messages you encountered, websites that helped, and so on: this document is a lab notebook, as it were. Bullet points and memos-to-self are fine. Put this text document into your private week one repo on github, along with any other files or digital things you happen to make. Call it your ‘notes.md’.\n  In a new text document, jot down some reflections -narrative, or bullet points, both are fine. Call it ‘journal.md’ This document also goes into your private week one repo on github. Detail any issues you had with getting started, any parts that caused you difficulty. If you got any error messages while trying to get set up, copy those into your reflection; google them. Do you find any websites that help you? What kind of ‘failures’ might you have encountered this week?\n  Drawing on your annotations of what you’ve read (and/or your notes from what you’ve listened to), discuss your idea of what ‘digital archaeology\u0026rsquo; might be prior to starting this course, and think through whether any of the materials we’ve seen this week confirm or upset those notions. What kind of archaeology have you encountered so far at Carleton, if at all?

If you spot an interesting annotation by someone else and it strikes a chord, respond generously to the annotation. Introduction I wanted you to have some experience of collecting data, and of how data models (or our expectations of what we\u0026rsquo;ll find) influence the subsequent work that we can do with the information that we collect. \u0026lsquo;Data\u0026rsquo; means things given but the goal (a goal) of this exercise is to see this information more like \u0026lsquo;capta\u0026rsquo; or things created/crafted/captured.\nArchaeology has some well established models for capturing the observations made at the trowel\u0026rsquo;s edge. In the UK for instance (where I did most of my archaeological training) the \u0026lsquo;single context\u0026rsquo; recording system as developed by the Museum of London Archaeology Service is more or less used (with variations) everywhere. (Here\u0026rsquo;s the manual).\nWe clearly can\u0026rsquo;t dig anything, in this time of Covid (and besides, it takes time to obtain a license to excavate in Ontario; looking at monuments in cemeteries however doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall under the rubric of the archaeological licensing scheme). We will be looking at archaeological data collected by others (from places like the Archaeological Data Service), but it seemed to me that you should experience just how much variability, reflexivity, and creativity is involved in trying to systematically collect information. Morgan and Eddisford argue (2019) that\n the introduction of single context recording not only had a dramatic impact on the way in which archaeology was undertaken, but also revolutionized the way social relations on site were structured. Single context recording promotes individual empowerment of diggers, allowing them to contribute to collective knowledge construction on site. Equally, it promoted a more horizontal management structure.\n In a way, the scheme that we are going to use (adapted from \u0026lsquo;Discovering England\u0026rsquo;s Burial Spaces\u0026rsquo; is similar to what Morgan and Eddisford say about single context recording: one grave at a time, you (plural) build up a broader picture of what is going on. But recognize this too: how we record data has an impact not just on the past, but the present (see also Perry 2018, 217)\nMortuary Archaeology The study of graveyards is one point where history and archaeology intersect, as both disciplines have their own bodies of literature connected with exploring how humans have dealt with their dead. I remember being taught as an undergrad the concept of seriation with reference to motifs on New England headstones (\u0026lsquo;Death\u0026rsquo;s Head, Cherub, Urn and Willow\u0026rsquo; by Deetz and Dethlefsen.)\nThe count of headstones with different motifs, when organized according to date of death, demonstrates how fashions evolve even within gravestone motifs. Which also means you can use a motif to suggest a likely date for a stone\u0026hellip;\nNow, mortuary archaeology as a branch of bioarchaeology has tended to focus more on the human remains (an overview by Bettina Arnold and Robert Jeske is available here).\nIn my own research (The Bone Trade Project) I am looking at how and why people buy human remains (which they do these days over Facebook and Instagram) using computer vision and machine learning (artificial intelligence). Many of the people whose remains are now being traded were stolen from their graves; many never even made it to the grave (people who died homeless, for instance, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could be claimed by schools of anatomy for dissection).\nOntario has a history of grave robbing as well - I found this notice in the Shawville Equity:\n “Dr. Eberson, a dentist well known through-out the Ottawa Valley, was found drowned in the Rideau Lake near Portland recently, and his body was interred in the cemetary at that place. A few days since it was found that the body had been stolen by human ghouls. The coffin was kicked in and badly damaged by the graverobbers\u0026hellip; No trace of the body has yet been discovered. “ – Shawville Equity, October 9 1890\n Katie Daubs, writing in the Toronto Star, has a long piece on the history of grave robbing in Ontario.\nA project looking at graveyards and gravestones therefore sets us up to talk about digital archaeology in a number of powerful and compelling ways.\nConclusion So it seemed to me that a project where we explored local graveyards would tie together many of the strands that I wanted this class to weave together. The information that you collect will be used later in the course for some statistical analysis, and for the eventual final outputs that we put together. The issues that all of this will raise, the techniques that you will be exposed to, the literature: all of these will help push you towards an ethical digital archaeology.\nWhen the day comes that you will work with other kinds of digital archaeological data, you will be able to revisit your notes and journal and have a head start on whatever task it is you wish to do.\n","description":"Rationale","id":4,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Graveyard Project Rationale","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/2/rationale/"},{"content":"What Gets Counted, Counts \nGoals for this week  recognize the strengths and weaknesses of our graveyard coding scheme uncover the ways in which \u0026lsquo;counting\u0026rsquo; hides or highlights the past encounter CSVs, SQL, and R and how to do some basic statistics  Listen Feed for the podcast here.\nRead  ‘What gets counted, counts’.

What good would it be to study memorialization in there?\nVirtual worlds are still human worlds, and the way death is memorialized in there might also provide us insight to how we construct death out here. Archaeology isn\u0026rsquo;t just about the past, remember. We spend a great deal of our waking hours in these virtual worlds. Perhaps studying memorialization in-world will give us insight into memorializations of the future? Perhaps it might tell us about how people form social relationships in-world?

If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation. Introduction This week, I am asking you to go out into your community and find a historic graveyard to work on. There was a graveyard in the middle of a field not far from the childhood home of a friend of mine. Who owned it? Who was responsible for it? Whose field was it in? Today, that field has been built over, with a couple of big box stores and a Tim Horton\u0026rsquo;s. The graveyard is still there, around back behind some dumpsters. It\u0026rsquo;s mostly overgrown, but periodically somebody hacks back some of the brush and picks up the garbage. Near where I live now, there is a historic graveyard in a corner of a city park, and the city keeps it clean and mows the lawn.\nBoth of these graveyards should be studied, but one of these is a safer place to work than the other.\nPersonal Safety \u0026gt; Course Work The first thing to keep in mind is that your personal safety is more important than course work. I have an alternative project for cases where it is either not safe or not feasible for you to go out to a historic (or currently active) graveyard. Just follow the instructions for the alternative project Things to consider This means that you will have to consider a number of elements before you go out:\n Can I actually get to the graveyard? Is it possible to work out who is responsible for the graveyard? If I see a graveyard called \u0026lsquo;Anytown United Cemetery\u0026rsquo; then I would look for the Anytown United Church and contact its office. Similarly for the Anytown Roman Catholic or the Anytown Free Methodist and so on. Small historic graveyards are often family cemeteries, and might be in a field or parcel of land belonging to the family. Or it might belong to someone else. You can explore historical land registry books (the link is for the City of Ottawa, but you can switch that) to find out the older history of the site. Obtain permission to survey the graveyard; speak to an individual rather than writing (you\u0026rsquo;ll get a quicker response). Use this form of words:   I would like to ask for permission to do a study of the grave monuments in [name of cemetery], as part of my coursework. This would involve photographing and measuring the stones. I will not be interfering with the stones or any of the planting or landscape. I believe it should not take me more than three or four days. The information I collect will be used in my class and ideally will be online if you agree. I can put you in contact with my Professor, Dr. Shawn Graham, if you have any questions about that aspect of the work.\n If you can\u0026rsquo;t find the owner (or if permission isn\u0026rsquo;t implied, as in the case of the graveyard in the public park mentioned above), or they decline your request, then do not survey that particular graveyard.\nConducting the Survey: Personal Safety  Do not go alone; take a companion Let people know where you are going, and when, and when you believe you will return Take a cellphone with you Bring water Wear sunscreen Wear appropriate clothing for a graveyard. Appropriate means \u0026lsquo;suitable to the task\u0026rsquo;; if the graveyard is overgrown, wear long pants and socks (ticks are a very real issue in Ontario). Similarly, if the graveyard is still active, there may well be mourners present and so be respectful. You represent the University. Conduct yourself accordingly. Do not sit on gravestones, put your lunch on a stone, or otherwise interfere with a grave.  Conducting the Survey Itself For instructions on how to conduct the survey itself, please begin by sketching the plan of the graveyard, and then how to record the graves\nSafety Online in the Case of Virtual Sites If you do the alternative project and the site you select features opportunities for online interactions, please take care; if it\u0026rsquo;s possible, create a character or use an account unrelated to your other online activities. Don\u0026rsquo;t engage with other players: ideally you want to be an observer in the space, rather than an active participant.\n","description":"instructions","id":8,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Working Safely","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/2/safework/"},{"content":"Futures of Digital Archaeology Goals for this week  TODO TODO TODO TODO  Listen Feed for the podcast here.\nRead  Huggett, Jeremy. 2017 The Apparatus of Digital Archaeology, Internet Archaeology 44. link\nDawson, Ian, and Reilly, Paul. 2019. “Messy Assemblages, Residuality and Recursion within a Phygital Nexus” Epoiesen link AND RESPONSE by Rachel Opitz link Morgan, Colleen. 2019.

You will need   a smartphone, tablet, or laptop\n  measuring tape (metric)\n  compass (optional)\n  notebook\n  if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a device that you can take into the field, you can print out multiple copies of the data entry form behind this link and then enter the data using the forms below on a desktop computer later.\n  Be sure to read the instructions on working safely.\nYou do not have to do this on your own; if Covid restrictions allow, and you know someone else in the class who lives close to you, then by all means work together. Ask a family member or other person in your \u0026lsquo;bubble\u0026rsquo; to go along with you.\nInstructions   Locate a local graveyard - historic or otherwise - and obtain permission to study the stones. A cemetery currently being used is probably the easiest place to work, as people are expected to be present, whereas historic graveyards might be on private land.\n  Devise a short id code for the graveyard. Archaeological sites in Canada are enumerated using a \u0026lsquo;Borden number\u0026rsquo; based roughly on the latitude and longitude of the site. We won\u0026rsquo;t use a Borden number (it\u0026rsquo;s entirely possible of course that a graveyard might actually have a Borden number if it was ever excavated or added to an inventory). For our purposes, devise a 4 letter code that abbreviates the common name for the graveyard. Eg., Norway Bay United Cemetery could be nwuc.\n  Follow the instructions on making a quick sketchmap to sketch out the portion of the graveyard (or the whole thing, if it\u0026rsquo;s not too big) that you are working in. Number each grave with a sequential series of numbers that incorporate the graveyard id code, eg nwuc-01, nwuc-02, etc.\n  We’ll use this scheme - http://debs.ac.uk/files/CodeSheets.pdf - to codify our observations for entry into our recording system. I would suggest that you print it out, staple it together, and bring it with you.\n  The numbering system builds up to describe a stone, monument, or tomb. For instance, in the illustration below, 1126, each digit is significant. The first 1 indicates chest and table tombs, the next two digits differentiate between chest tomb with plain sides (11) and chest tomb with rectangular panelled sides, 12, and then the final digit describes the decoration on the top, 6, what is called a double bale. Headstones begin with 4 and the combination of digits can be used to describe quite complex shapes and motifs.\nThen, record the stone \u0026amp; the inscription with this: https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/uIGvnNmd. It works best with Chrome. Deciding precisely which numbers best describe what you are observing will be a challenge. As you work, make a note of problems you encounter with the scheme - what assumptions are literally encoded that do not seem to reflect what you are seeing? Are there shapes that just don\u0026rsquo;t seem to fit?  Before you go out to the graveyard These forms can be used for off-line data recording. Open the link on a smartphone or tablet when you are connected to wifi or data. On the top right of most mobile browsers, there\u0026rsquo;s a button you can click for options; one of these will be \u0026lsquo;add to home screen\u0026rsquo;  You fill in as many of the fields as possible, but make sure to always add the ID for the graveyard and for the stone in question. The location field will try to automatically get your location from your device; the plus-minus on this can be quite variable. Do take a photograph (there is a field that will do that). When you press the submit button at the bottom of the form, the results will be queued and saved locally in your device, and then you can record the next stone. Once you turn data on or are back in wifi range, your results will upload automatically to the server.\n  You can record the personal information on the stones with this form, which works in the exact same way: https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/vFoK4DMY\n  I am imagining that recording between 5 and 10 stones will be feasible for you to do over the course of this week and next.\nYour data will upload to a server that I have access to, and be collated with the work of everyone else in the class. We will explore and use this data in the following weeks.\n","description":"The Grave Yard Project","id":10,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Record","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/2/do-the-project/"},{"content":"Consolidation Pause II Goals for this week  TODO TODO TODO TODO  Listen Feed for the podcast here.\nDo  Use this time to catch up on anything you didn\u0026rsquo;t read, to try some of the exercises over again, and to consolidate what you\u0026rsquo;ve achieved so far.

If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation. Introduction Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. \u0026lsquo;Git\u0026rsquo; is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state. It also allows you to create branches, or duplicates of your folder, so you can experiment. If you like the results of your work, you can merge that branch back into your original.\nGithub therefore is a hub for sharing these git snapshots.\nA branch (a copy, a duplicate) of your work uploaded to Github could therefore be copied to say my account (a fork); then I might download to my machine to work on it (I\u0026rsquo;ve pulled it). Once I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my changes, I commit them (save them to the sequence of changes that Git tracks), and then I could push those changes to the fork in my account. I would then send you a pull notice, asking you to pull my changes back to your account; you could then decide whether or not to merge.\nFor our purposes, you will use Github mostly as a place to put your reflections or other pieces of work. I might sometimes fork your work, pull it down onto my machine, make changes that I commit, push it back online, and ask you to pull the changes back. But that won\u0026rsquo;t happen very often. It takes a while to get comfortable with this.\nGet your account  Got to github.com and sign up for an account. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to use your real name. (Protip: You might want to set up an email just for signing up for things.)  Verify your account.  Select the free tier (nb: I will never require you to pay for any reading, or any software. If something wants you to pay, stop and ask for help).  Skip telling Github anything about yourself.  Do the verification email thing. Once you hit the verification link in your email, you\u0026rsquo;ll be brought back to Github to make a new repository:  Give it a reasonable name; tick the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme\u0026rsquo; box, tick off the \u0026lsquo;private\u0026rsquo; box, and hit the green commit button:  And on the final page, hit the \u0026lsquo;dismiss\u0026rsquo; button in the \u0026lsquo;Github Actions box\u0026rsquo;  Ta Da! You now have a github account, and you\u0026rsquo;ve created your first repository. Going Forward create a new repository for each week\u0026rsquo;s work/reflection. You can create a new repository from the plus sign in the top right corner:\nnb Remember to tick off the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme.md\u0026rsquo; file.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, you\u0026rsquo;ll be at your Github user page:\nAdd me as a collaborator to this and subsequent private repositories:   Then, once you\u0026rsquo;ve clicked on \u0026lsquo;manage access\u0026rsquo;, click on \u0026lsquo;invite collaborator\u0026rsquo;,\n  Then find my username shawngraham, and add me:\n  Setting up a \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; for your work A \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; is just a folder that you\u0026rsquo;ve shared on Github. There are two ways to do this; the easy way and the more complex way. Luck you, you have already done the easy way - you selected the initialize with a readme, and it\u0026rsquo;s already present in your browser!\nTo create new repositories, just click on the + button on the top right of your Github page when you\u0026rsquo;re logged in. You might want to go ahead now and create repositories for week 2 through to week 12. Remember to tick off the initialize with a readme box. Remember to make them private. But if you didn\u0026rsquo;t tick the initialize box, you\u0026rsquo;ve embarked on the more complex way. In the screenshot below, I created a new repository but I forgot to initialize it, and now I\u0026rsquo;m looking at this page:\nIf this is you, do not despair.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten to initialize a new repo:  If you have a PC, click on this link to download and install git. Make a new directory on your computer with the same name as the repo you created above. In my example, that would be week-two. On a PC, right-click on the folder and select \u0026lsquo;open a command prompt here\u0026rsquo;. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, select Keyboard \u0026gt; Shortcuts \u0026gt; Services. Look for \u0026lsquo;New Terminal at Folder\u0026rsquo; and tick the box. Open your finder; find the folder you created, right-click and select \u0026lsquo;open Terminal here\u0026rsquo;. Do you see where, in your browser at github, it says ...or create a new repository on the command line? Type in each line exactly as it is there (beginning with echo), hitting enter at the end of each line, in order. If the command works, you\u0026rsquo;ll just be presented with the next prompt. The computer only ever responds when there is output to print - which often means only when there is an error message to report.  Ta da! You can now go to github.com\\\u0026lt;your-user-name\u0026gt;\\your-repo and you\u0026rsquo;ll see it all there tickety boo.\nMaking a new text file on Github You can make a new text file by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;create new file\u0026rsquo; button; remember to always use .md as the file extension. You can specify headers, links, images, bullets, blockquotes and so on by using markdown conventions\nThe two videos below might be a bit clearer on youtube itself.\n  Uploading a file into Github You can add new files from your computer by dragging and dropping them into the main repository. At the end of this video, I show you how to display the image in the text of the reflection.\n  Going further Github can also be used to run an entire website, generated from your text files. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s how I built this course website! The following three links are from my HIST4806a 2020 seminar on digital history and museums; they will walk you through how to use your Github account to serve up a professional scholarly website; you can use this scholarly website to host your reflections and course work, if you want. Follow these three pages in order:\n  Building Your Own Scholarly Website\n  Customizing Your Scholarly Website\n  Updating Your Scholarly Website\n  ","description":"instructions","id":13,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Setting up your Github","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/1/github/"},{"content":"\nCommunicating Digital Archaeology Goals for this week  TODO TODO TODO TODO  Listen Feed for the podcast here.\nRead  ‘The Numbers Don’t Speak for Themselves’ Draft chapter from Data Feminism by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein link Ben Marwick, Carl Boettiger \u0026amp; Lincoln Mullen. 2018.

How do archaeologists use digital technologies on site, in the lab, or on the web? This course explores the intersection of digital technologies and computing with archaeology. We will explore the ways theory gets embedded into computation; perhaps there is even a theory of digital archaeology? We will explore how digital technologies allow us to ask questions that would otherwise be impossible to ask. We will consider the ethical ramifications of our digital tools and opaque algorithms. We will also look into the ways that computational creativity in archaeology allow for novel engagements with the past, thus moving us into a digital public archaeology.\nYou do not need to be \u0026lsquo;techy\u0026rsquo; to be successful in this course! You just need to be diligent, honest, and open. You will read, watch, listen to, and discuss the class materials via various online tools including Hypothes.is and Github (Speaking of Hypothes.is, highlight a word on this page and see what happens). We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead. Successful completion of this class involves doing a series of exercises each week designed to push you out of your comfort zone, AND to be a collegial and generous scholar engaging with, and helping your peers to achieve success. What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go. Thus open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked, is a meaningful aspect of this course. Again: You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.\nThe Most Important Idea Archaeology\u0026rsquo;s genesis was in racism, and colonialism.\nDigital technology\u0026rsquo;s birth was in the violence of war, and the control of systems.\nIf you put those two things together without taking into account the implications then we\u0026rsquo;re in for a lot of trouble.\nSo what I want to know is, can digital archaeology be taught, be learned, be practiced, in such a way that we unpick those two trajectories, those two monstrous births, and use digital archaeology to better understand communities, empower people, and give better, more compelling, more truthful stories about what it means to be human?\nArchaeology isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily about the past. It\u0026rsquo;s about the materiality of the past and present and in many ways, the future. We try to understand what it is to be human through the extended abilities that tool use, that objects and their agencies, give to us. The digital tools we use and are entangled with extend humanity in powerful ways - and in 2020, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to see how digital technologies have extended humanity\u0026rsquo;s worst impulses.\nMy goal here is to teach you to use certain digital techs; to unpack and interrogate those techs you learn to use; and to equip you to use these things in a reflective manner. It\u0026rsquo;s about archaeology using computation; but also, looking at computation from an archaeological perspective. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be uncomfortable. Not only that, this is the first iteration of the course. That makes you my accomplices. There will be things we try here that will not work. That\u0026rsquo;s why part of the exit ticket for this course will be for you to rethink the one part of the course that was most affecting for you to make it better, but also, to think through who it might harm.\nText/Tech To the best of my ability, all materials will either be open access materials on the web or materials made available to us through MacOdrum Library or the University. You will not be required to purchase any set text or software.\nWe will be using elements of the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook Environment https://o-date.github.io; we may in fact re-write parts of it as a result of our work, in which case you will be credited as a co-author.\nHaving a reasonably up-to-date computer will make life easier for you; if you use a chromebook or a low-powered laptop (eg, less than 8 gb of RAM), this will require us to think creatively about some of the work, but should not present an insurmountable obstacle. A good internet connection will make life easier, but I realize that not everyone is well-served by our tech oligopolies. Please let me know if these situations apply to you so that we can work out a suitable plan of action.\nClass format This class will be delivered online, asynchronously. A Discord server will be used to provide a social context to our work, for help, and for collaboration. Learning materials will be curated on this open course website, and might include a variety of modalities. There will be no required synchronous chats or lectures. Students will maintain course research notebooks on the web (which may be anonymous or pseudonymous or made private provided access is shared with me).\n","description":"what to tell your friends","id":22,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"1. Course Description","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/docs/1-coursedescription/"},{"content":"Questions I developed this course with a couple of questions in mind, things I wanted to know the answers to. Digital archaeology - what the hell is it, anyway? What is it for? Is it just a \u0026lsquo;follower\u0026rsquo;, repurposing other tools \u0026amp; techniques, a supporting skill for \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; archaeology? Let\u0026rsquo;s set ourselves a grand challenges: what can digital archaeology be?\nThis course is a formalized exploration of these questions; I do not know the answers! I\u0026rsquo;m excited to figure these out with you.\nNb The process of teaching is also a process of collaboration between me and you. This is the first time this course has been taught. Sometimes -and we\u0026rsquo;re expecting this, you and I- things won\u0026rsquo;t work as we expect; tech might break; the world might impinge too much. We will adapt accordingly. Remember: the grade in this course is a function of your process and your evolution, so adapting and thinking through the implications of when things don\u0026rsquo;t go according to plan is, in fact, according to plan. Outcomes  Situate the emergence and evolution of digital archaeology within the historiography of archaeology more broadly Implement and contribute to a digital archaeology gravestones\u0026rsquo; and monuments survey Investigate data, artifacts, and primary sources, using the methods/techniques/perspectives of digital archaeology and digital humanities Develop online experiences that communicate the results of these investigations as an act of public digital archaeology Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently. However, no one operates in a vacuum; digital archaeologists collaborate to troubleshoot or develop technologies, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others’ work in a collaborative fashion.  Texts See the weekly work section. All readings are open access.\nReal Names Policy You do not need to use your real name or identity on any public-facing work that you do in this course. Nor do you need to explain to me that you wish to use a pseudonym. It is sufficient that you send an email to me with the following message:\n‘I would like to use the following username in all public-facing work: xxxxxxxx’\n…where xxxxx is the name you have selected. For safety’s sake, if you decide to use a pseudonym, do not use one that you have used on any other website or social media platform.\nWhen Life Intervenes There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, in this class. That said, I can\u0026rsquo;t help you if I don\u0026rsquo;t know you need help, a breathing space, some direction. When something comes up, just let me know:\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something has intervened. I trust you.\r When something comes up and this course has to move to the backburner, contact me and we can figure out something else to do, or something else that will help you be successful here. It\u0026rsquo;s our course - we can change things up as we need to.\n","description":"what you'll get out of this course","id":23,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"2.

See the assessment page for further details.\nSome exercises are collaborative for the class as a whole. Some are individual. There will sometimes be a choice of exercise.\nAll work for a given module has to be completed and submitted before the next module begins. Late work cannot be accepted unless you obtain permission from Dr. Graham. Just talk with him, if something comes up.

Course Calendar","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/docs/3-schedule/"},{"content":"There is no midterm. There is no final exam.\r Weekly Work Each week, there are tasks for you to attempt. Sometimes there is a choice of which tasks to do; in those cases, I\u0026rsquo;m not looking for the number of these that you complete, but that you push yourself out of your comfort level.\nWeekly work must be completed and logged by the end of the relevant week. Dr Graham will provide ungraded feedback on this work in order to help you grow. There are three \u0026lsquo;consolidation\u0026rsquo; weeks in the schedule, where you\u0026rsquo;ll prepare a \u0026lsquo;consolidation document\u0026rsquo; that will be graded. Late work can be accepted only through arrangement with Dr. Graham.\nIf you miss a week, or something comes up let Dr. Graham know as soon as possible so that arrangements can be made. I want you to be successful; if something comes up we can adapt accordingly. If you do not let me know, then I cannot help you.\nEvidence for Your Weekly Logs I am looking for the following kinds of evidence (each week will specify what needs to be done):\n logs/lab notebook entry that keep track of what you actually did reflection on that process engagement with the materials and your classmates (which might be demonstrated many different ways) evidence for your growth as a scholar over this course  At the end of each week by Sunday evening, you will provide to me through a form that can be found on each weekly page the links to your evidence for me to consider.\nI will return feedback to you within two or three days. I will write you a short note giving you my perspective on what you\u0026rsquo;ve done (using the lens of the learning outcomes), and offering advice. This weekly work is to help you grow. It is not formally assigned a grade, but it does provide evidence of your growth against the learning outcomes, and your engagement with it does play into your eventual final grade.\nConsolidation Weeks Every fourth week (that is, at the end of each module) you will submit a \u0026lsquo;consolidation document\u0026rsquo;. Consolidation weeks give you the space to try something again, or finish doing something that you had to put aside earlier. This document is where you can show me that you\u0026rsquo;ve taken my feedback and considered it and adapted/adopted accordingly. These are short documents.\n Module 1 consolidation document: due at the end of week four; may be submitted in the following week if you notify me in week four. Module 2 consolidation document: due at the end of week eight; may be submitted in the following week if you notify me in week eight. Module 3 consolidation document: due at the end of week twelve; may be submitted in the following week if you notify me in week twelve.  Do not attempt to speedrun this course. By \u0026lsquo;speedrun\u0026rsquo; I mean, you leave it until the end and try to do all of the work in one intense session. Work done in that fashion cannot, by virtue of it all being dumped in my lap at the end of the course, take into account feedback, peer collaboration, or have any meaningful engagement with the materials. Do not do this. The Exit Ticket You will produce an \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; for me at the end of the course (open format) reflecting on where you started and where you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you\u0026rsquo;ve done against the learning outcomes. The exit ticket is a summary assessment exercise that will pull all the different strings together into a strong cord. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s journey is different. Digital methods are more a matter of practice and time than they are of aptitude.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve never done digital work before, it might be that you never quite manage to get as many of the tech things working as you might\u0026rsquo;ve wanted: but you now know what you didn\u0026rsquo;t know before. That\u0026rsquo;s a win. You might be a computer science minor and the tech materials don\u0026rsquo;t present you with much challenge: but figuring out how to tell the compelling story was very difficult for you but you\u0026rsquo;re better at it now. Your \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; will explain to me your particular context, and it will point to the evidence that demonstrates how you\u0026rsquo;ve moved along from where you were at the beginning to where you are now.\nIf I agree with your assessment, then that is the grade you will receive (thus, you have the opportunity to override the percentage breakdowns below).\nWhen I have disagreed in previous courses this has been, 9.5 times out of 10, to raise the grade: y\u0026rsquo;all are too hard on yourselves. If I have disagreed and felt that you\u0026rsquo;ve overstated things - if you were the 0.5 out of 10 - we would talk and come to an agreement.\nThe Exit Ticket should be submitted within one week of the last day of the fall term.\nGrading Remembering the learning outcomes,\n   Learning Outcome A B C D eg. Jo Q Student     1. analytical ability - - - - X   2. methodology - - - - -   3. collaboration - - - - X   4. argumentation - - - - X   5. professionalization - - - - -    \u0026hellip;5/5 would be an A, 4/5 would be a B, 3/5 would be a C, 2/5 a D.\nIn this example, based on my consideration of Jo Q Student\u0026rsquo;s evidence and the feedback I\u0026rsquo;d written him over the six weeks, it seemed to me that he did what he needed to do (satisfactorily) for 3 out of the 5 outcomes and so earned a C. However, his exit ticket might bring him up. Percentage Breakdown I am required by the University to provide a percentage breakdown.\nConsolidation documents = 75%\nFinal Exit ticket = 25%\nI reserve the right to adjust those percentages to take into account the particular circumstances of the student.\n","description":"grading and ungrading","id":25,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"4.

Rather, I am trying to help you learn the skills that you will need to uncover whatever aspect of method and thought that will help you with your research goals. A big part of that is trying to teach how to deal with what might feel like \u0026lsquo;failure\u0026rsquo;, on first blush. I want you to swing for the bleachers, and not to be afraid of whiffing on the ball. After all, to mix sporting metaphors, you\u0026rsquo;re here for icetime not the Stanley Cup.\nOn another note, this course originally was intended to be a kind of hybrid course, blending face to face work in the classroom with resources and digital tools.\nThat of course, can\u0026rsquo;t happen at the moment.\nMoving online just means that I have to work harder at fostering the social aspect of learning and education.\nSocial Contact Another problem with moving fully online is isolation. Working with digital tools and environments, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re not overly familiar with how they work - or even the underlying metaphors that would help you make sense of what\u0026rsquo;s going on - is frustrating. Bad enough when you have classmates you see twice a week and can at least complain with over coffee later; extremely awful when you\u0026rsquo;re on a bad internet connection and everyone thinks that you\u0026rsquo;re not really doing schoolwork.\nIn past classes, I have used Slack as a way of trying to meet that need for human connection that makes learning meaningful.

Instructions will seem vague or incomplete - or worse, I will have indeed forgotten to tell you something crucial.\nOr worse, I\u0026rsquo;ve made an assumption about your understanding, and left things unsaid that needed to be made explicit. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of this, in the digital world, in fact.\nThis week, you learned a bit about Git and Github. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at a question on the q-and-a site, \u0026lsquo;Stackoverflow\u0026rsquo; here. Just scroll through that question, and look at some of the answers. Make a note of any terms or code or responses that make not an ounce of sense to you.\nIt can make you feel rather overwhelmed, rather quickly. And like most places on the internet, StackOverflow has its own culture, its own norms of expression and behaviour. People who are new can get roasted. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons we have our own discord server, and a private reading group on Hypothesis: these are places for you to ask for help from a community that understands where you\u0026rsquo;re coming from because we\u0026rsquo;re all in the same headspace.\nSo, when things go wrong, the first thing to do is to find the community that understands where you\u0026rsquo;re coming from. I read and search StackOverflow all the time, but I rarely ask questions there. Instead, I write to trusted colleagues. And they in turn write to me.\nBut there are a couple of things we can do to make life easier.\nAsking good questions StackOverflow does have good advice on asking good questions. I will excerpt some of their advice:\n Write a title that summarizes the specific problem\u0026hellip; If you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble summarizing the problem, write the title last - sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.\n  Introduce the problem before you post any code [or a screenshot or a video clip]\u0026hellip;start by expanding on the summary you put in the title. Explain how you encountered the problem you\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself.\n  Help others reproduce the problem [SG: post the code, post a screenshot, post a video clip walk through]\n Please do this.\nEvery term, I receive dozens of emails with the subject line \u0026lsquo;help\u0026rsquo; and the message body \u0026lsquo;i tried it and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rsquo;. Sometimes, the message will also say \u0026lsquo;i worked on it for 3 hrs and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rsquo;.\nNone of that is helpful. Telling me that you worked on it for 3 hours just shows me that you ignored my messages about \u0026lsquo;if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come after 30 minutes, take a break, ask for help\u0026rsquo;.\nCollect all of the information together, put it in a file in your repo, and share the link in discord or post the whole thing in the relevant channel.\nPlease, PLEASE, don\u0026rsquo;t just post something that says, \u0026lsquo;it didn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rsquo; and then leave it at that. What\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;it\u0026rsquo;? What were you expecting to happen? What did you try? Show me\u0026hellip;\nAnswering questions As the course progresses, you will have many opportunities to ask for help from me and from your peers - post these in our discord server in the appropriate channel.\nSometimes, you will see questions that you can answer. A few guidelines for answering questions:\n There are many different ways to solve these issues; someone might post a different way but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that either of you are necessarily wrong. Read the question carefully. Request clarification if there are bits that the original poster didn\u0026rsquo;t make clear - help them to ask better questions. Use screenshots and screenvideo (I find screencastomatic handy in this regard) to show how things worked for you. Provide links to useful relevant material if you know of it. Assume the best of everyone: not everyone has the same fluency with these machines, and it takes a while to learn the language.  Answering the questions of your peers, helping them out, is an excellent way to meet one of the course outcomes.\n","description":"Good questions make life easier","id":31,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Asking for help","uri":"https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/1/help/"},{"content":"The Last Bit The last bit of the course is the Exit Ticket.\nListen Do The format of the exit ticket is up to you. You craft a statement reflecting on where you started and where you’ve gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you’ve done against the learning outcomes. You may, if you wish, indicate what you think your letter grade ought to be, and why.\n[more]\nSubmit work You can submit the link to your work on this form\nCelebrate This hasn\u0026rsquo;t been - I\u0026rsquo;ll wager - an easy journey for you.
