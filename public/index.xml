        <guid>https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/5/basic-r-stats/</guid>
        <description>R is a programming language for statistics that is used frequently by archaeologists (the other popular option is Python). One of the advantages of scripting or writing out your analysis as a sequence of commands is that anyone can look at your code and understand what you did and why it worked.

This is a computational notebook: a computer that you access through the website. The idea here is that these notebooks mix comments and code in a single document.

        <guid>https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/3/photogrammetry/</guid>
        <description>Introduction Photogrammetry is the process whereby multiple photographs of an object are stitched together to make a 3d model of the object; the photographs are then draped over the model to make it photorealistic. Because of the physics of photography (focal distances of lenses and so on) a computer can calculate the relative positioning of overlapping points it identifies in multiple photographs, and with a bit of trig it works out the points-in-space.</description>

        <guid>https://hist3000.netlify.app/week/5/kobotoolbox/</guid>
        <description>Introduction   The KoBoToolbox is an open source platform that allows you to design quite complex data collection forms, for use via computers or devices, both online and offline.
Ipads and similar have been used in archaeology since their invention, at places for example like Pompeii and other sites destroyed by Vesuvius. The potential applications for devices like this to speed up data acquisition and analysis practically fill entire volumes, but at the same time, leave some archaeologists worried that we&amp;rsquo;re missing something fundamental about doing archaeology, that we need a &amp;lsquo;slow&amp;rsquo; archaeology to counter them.</description>

I want you to explore the following sites and annotate what you find, using our hypothes.is reading group (nb don&amp;rsquo;t use the &amp;lsquo;public&amp;rsquo; group!), tying what you&amp;rsquo;re seeing to ideas you encountered in the readings.

they don&amp;rsquo;t have to complete all the stuff in this one, but there are enough examples in this to keep them going forever.
have them use something from in here on graveyards data.
or at least, identify something they&amp;rsquo;d like to use on graveyards data once they figure things out (in the install_packages folder there&amp;rsquo;s basic_gis_not_using_sf that has point pattern analysis in it that might be useful, although might not be able to install in our virtual machine)</description>

 the cemetery that you have worked on the location of stones  The East End Cemetery website maps a historic African American burial ground in Henrico County and the city of Richmond, Virginia, and uses Leaflet:</description>

If someone does help you, just add their name to the appropriate spot in the document that will result from this exercise.</description>

        <description>Before you head out to the graveyard that you intend to record, I want you to make a sketchmap to bring with you.
While the digital recording system that we are using can read the geolocation of your device when you are standing at a stone, the accuracy of that location might not be enough for us to understand any spatial patterns that might exist. While testing the system in a local graveyard, I found that stones a few feet apart would show up on the map (using my cellphone&amp;rsquo;s geolocation) hundreds of feet apart.</description>

        <description>Introduction This page is for those of you who zipped through the other materials this week.
Remember: just because I give you all these options does not mean you must complete all of them. I&amp;rsquo;m asking you to start with the easier ones, and then push yourself to try the others. Spatial archaeology looks at the patterning of the remains of human activity in (usually geographic) space over time. It can encompass working with geographic information systems, and it can encompass web mapping (on which see ODATE 3.</description>

        <description>Zotero is a piece of software for managing your research. When it is installed, it can extract metadata from websites or pdfs (when these have metadata) and store the information in your very own library. Zotero can be connected to Word or Google Docs so that when it is time to insert a reference, you can select the reference from your library - and then get the machine to automatically format/update your bibliography against whatever citation style you use.</description>

        <description>HIST3000|CLCV3000 Fall 2020 Department of History, Carleton University Once the excavation is over, what happens to the information created through archaeological research? How do archaeologists use digital technologies on site, in the lab, or on the web? This course explores the intersection of digital technologies and computing with archaeology. We will explore the ways theory gets embedded into computation; perhaps there is even a theory of digital archaeology? We will explore how digital technologies allow us to ask questions that would otherwise be impossible to ask.</description>

        <description>Questions I developed this course with a couple of questions in mind, things I wanted to know the answers to. Digital archaeology - what the hell is it, anyway? What is it for? Is it just a &amp;lsquo;follower&amp;rsquo;, repurposing other tools &amp;amp; techniques, a supporting skill for &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; archaeology? Let&amp;rsquo;s set ourselves a grand challenges: what can digital archaeology be?
This course is a formalized exploration of these questions; I do not know the answers!</description>

        <description>Each week involves completing to the best of your ability various exercises; you will document your progress in a weekly log that you will keep online. Log entries are required to be completed by the Sunday evening at the end of the relevant work. A final reflection piece is due at the end of the course. See the assessment page for further details.
Some exercises are collaborative for the class as a whole.</description>

        <description>There is no midterm. There is no final exam. Weekly Work Each week, there are tasks for you to attempt. Sometimes there is a choice of which tasks to do; in those cases, I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for the number of these that you complete, but that you push yourself out of your comfort level.
Weekly work must be completed and logged by the end of the relevant week. Dr Graham will provide ungraded feedback on this work in order to help you grow.</description>

Welcome! Check your Carleton email account this morning for a note from me about getting started in the class.
There are no zoom meetings in this class (balloons, confetti, streamers fall from ceiling, much rejoicing, etc).
There is a discord server for a class social space and for video, audio chat &amp;amp; screensharing (which is useful when things go wrong and you want someone to look at what you&amp;rsquo;re doing).</description>

        <description>The following are the University regulations common to all History courses. COPIES OF WRITTEN WORK SUBMITTED Always retain for yourself a copy of all essays, term papers, written assignments or take-home tests submitted in your courses.
PLAGIARISM The University Senate defines plagiarism as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as one’s own.” This can include:
 reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s own without proper citation or reference to the original source; submitting a take home examination, essay, laboratory report or other assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else; using ideas or direct, verbatim quotations, or paraphrased material, concepts, or ideas without appropriate acknowledgment in any academic assignment; using another’s data or research findings; failing to acknowledge sources through the use of proper citations when using another’s works and/or failing to use quotation marks; handing in &amp;ldquo;substantially the same piece of work for academic credit more than once without prior written permission of the course instructor in which the submission occurs.</description>

        <description>As a general philosophy of learning, I do not aim for coverage. Rather, I am trying to help you learn the skills that you will need to uncover whatever aspect of method and thought that will help you with your research goals. A big part of that is trying to teach how to deal with what might feel like &amp;lsquo;failure&amp;rsquo;, on first blush. I want you to swing for the bleachers, and not to be afraid of whiffing on the ball.</description>

Things are going to go wrong. Things are going to break. Instructions will seem vague or incomplete - or worse, I will have indeed forgotten to tell you something crucial.
Or worse, I&amp;rsquo;ve made an assumption about your understanding, and left things unsaid that needed to be made explicit. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of this, in the digital world, in fact.
This week, you learned a bit about Git and Github.</description>

Listen Do The format of the exit ticket is up to you. You craft a statement reflecting on where you started and where you’ve gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you’ve done against the learning outcomes. You may, if you wish, indicate what you think your letter grade ought to be, and why.
