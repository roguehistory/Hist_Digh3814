Each week involves completing to the best of your ability various exercises; you will document your progress in a weekly log that you will keep online. Log entries are required to be completed by the Sunday evening at the end of the relevant work. A final reflection piece is due at the end of the course. See the [assessment page for further details](docs/4-assessment).

Some exercises are collaborative for the class as a whole. Some are individual. There will sometimes be a choice of exercise.

{{< alert theme="warning" >}}
All work for a given module has to be completed and submitted before the next module begins. Late work cannot be accepted _unless you obtain permission from Dr. Graham_. Just talk with him, if something comes up.
