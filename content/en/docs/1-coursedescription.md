## Overview

What impact(s) does the ‘Digital’ have on the production of ancient and medieval history? What is Digital History? What does it mean to perform Digital History, and is Digital History a Public History? In this course, we will explore the above questions by introducing students to the approaches used to create digital narratives in History and Archaeology. We will discuss how the ‘digital’ influences the construction, curation and maintenance of historical and archaeological narratives.

In this course, we will experiment with various digital tools and discuss their impact on how we analyze historical documentation and material culture of the ancient and medieval world. Through experiential learning exercises and case studies, students will actively explore and critically investigate the intersection of ancient and medieval history, archaeology, and digital humanities within the context of public history. The course emphasizes the ‘digital process’ to provide students with the digital skills, tools, and knowledge to confidently navigate, investigate, and critically evaluate historical or archaeological narratives, and pursue their interests in their final digital projects. **However, this does not mean the course will be tech-heavy.**

Instead, students are exposed to digital tools and encouraged to consider questions such as: How are authorship, content creation, and user engagement with digital history defined? Who pays for free software? Can Digital Heritage and Digital Artifacts be owned? What does the profusion of popular medieval historical representations in digital media mean for the future of academic history? Is the podcast a legitimate medium to disseminate academic research compared to the monograph or academic journal? 


### Text/Tech

To the best of my ability, all materials will either be open access materials on the web or materials made available to us through MacOdrum Library or the University. You will not be required to purchase any set text or software.

We will be using elements of the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook Environment [https://o-date.github.io](https://o-date.github.io/); we may in fact re-write parts of it as a result of our work, in which case you will be credited as a co-author.

Having a reasonably up-to-date computer will make life easier for you; if you use a chromebook or a low-powered laptop (eg, less than 8 gb of RAM), this will require us to think creatively about some of the work, but should not present an insurmountable obstacle. A good internet connection will make life easier, but I realize that not everyone is well-served by our tech oligopolies. **Please let me know if these situations apply to you** so that we can work out a suitable plan of action.

### You are not alone!

This class will be delivered online, asynchronously. A Discord server will be used to provide a social context for our work, to offer or ask for help, and facilitate collaboration. Learning materials will be curated on this open course website, and might include a variety of modalities. **There will be no required synchronous chats or lectures.** Students will maintain course research notebooks on the web (which may be anonymous or pseudonymous or made private provided access is shared with me).

You will also notice that I often use *"WE"*. Why? First, [H]istory is not performed in a vacuum. This is especially true for Digital History, as *we* will learn in this course. [H]istory is collaborative knowledge production and storytelling that needs to be engaging and socially relatable. Otherwise, why bother? However, I don't want to inundate you with technical jargon and scare you away (that would be counter-productive). Instead, I want to challenge you to think about how **WE,** as historians, archaeologists, public historians, digital humanists, and the public, can reframe, narrate and craft digital history together, generously, and with integrity.

Secondly, the *"We"* is precisely what it means. You and I will explore, discuss, and collaborate throughout the course. Western academia/universities are embedded with colonialist structures that have created hierarchical systems that produce dynamic and intimidating power structures. The professor-student relationship is one of those structures that, in some cases, can oppress or discourage the student's ability to be creative and produce new and insightful historical narratives. I aim to foster and promote a constructive learning environment that emphasizes rigorous, generous and creative historical narrative construction. [My Gothic Dissertation](https://www.mygothicdissertation.com)  , by Dr. Anna Williams, provides excellent examples of exploited power imbalances in academia between professors and students, in addition to the thesis's exploration of the Gothic literary genre. 

### You do not need to be Techy. 
{{< alert theme="info" >}}
**You do not need to be 'techy' to be successful in this course! You just need to be diligent, honest, and open.** Nevertheless, you will be exposed to several platforms, techs, and approaches that you may not have experienced before. **The key is to be open** and willing to talk about when things don't go as expected. No one knows everything about tech. 
{{< /alert >}}

You will read, watch, listen to, and discuss the class materials via various online tools, including [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is) and [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) (Speaking of Hypothes.is, highlight a word on this page and see what happens). We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead.  What is challenging for one student may not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and encourage others as you progress. Thus, open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked is a meaningful aspect of this course. **Again: You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.**

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
My goal here is to teach you to use specific digital technologies; to unpack and critically examine those technologies you learn to use; and to equip you to utilize these tools in a reflective manner.

It's going to be uncomfortable. There will be things we try here that will not work. That's why the assessment for this course is built around the _process_, not the final _product_.

### Course Material
To the best of my ability, all materials will be either open-access materials on the web or materials made available to us through the MacOdrum Library or the University. You will not be required to purchase any set text or software. 

There are no required texts for this course.
Note: All listed materials without a link can be found on the HIST/DIGH 3814 course page in ARES through Carleton’s Library services. Book Chapters are available there as PDFs, and are also on reserve. Please Note: All selected readings are subject to revision and change, depending on course direction/needs.


### Class format
This class will be delivered asynchronously with the expectation that students complete modules by the assigned due dates. **Do Not Speed Run This Course**. Don't leave everything until the night before it's due. This course is not designed to accommodate this type of approach and will likely negatively impact your grade. **Collaboration is an essential component of this class, enabling the production of effective and engaging Digital History and Archaeology.** A Discord server will be used to provide a social context for our work, offer help, and facilitate collaboration. Learning materials will be curated on the course website and might include a variety of modalities. Students will maintain various materials on the class Obsidian Vault via Dropbox, which I will add you to with your Carleton email account. 

### Your Success

Your success in this class is dependent on three principles:

1) **Be Prepared**. Do the readings, be prepared to discuss and collaborate with me and your peers. Each module is designed to explore and discuss the assigned readings and podcasts and how they can inform our research objectives and goals. I will not be provide pre-recorded lectures. I will provide continuous feedback via Discord, Hyptohes.is and Discussion forums. 

2) **Be Fearless**. Yoda said to Luke: "Do – or do not. There is no try." (Starwars, Episode V), which is the worst advice, I believe. I want you to **TRY** new tools and venture into the swampy digital unknown. Be fearless and swing for the fences. Don’t worry if something doesn't go as planned. The digital is a process – a journey – which we will navigate together, despite what Yoda thinks. I've failed and broke things more times than I can count. 

3) **Fail Gloriously**. Words I live by now (Thank you, Dr. Shawn Graham). So, when we try new methods, theories, and digital tools, we are bound to make mistakes. Digital things will break or not work: that is expected. If you can say, 'I wonder _why_ this broke? Can you help me?' You will be successful here.


For this course to work well, I require you to be on the same page as me. **COMMUNICATION IS KEY!** Do not be afraid to ask a question. Please see me during virtual office hours or schedule an appointment if you need help or are feeling discouraged. This course offers a lot of flexibility, but it also requires you to push yourself out of your comfort zone. The key thing is always to tie what you're doing with what you're reading and what you're thinking. That 'second layer of difficulty' will come with practice. But how it intersects with everything else: that's where the learning happens.

...and that is why this course is the way it is. No doubt, things will break, and some will work better or be more effective than others. We will roll with it.
