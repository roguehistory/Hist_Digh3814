### HIST3000|CLCV3000 Fall 2020 Department of History, Carleton University

Once the excavation is over, what happens to the information created through archaeological research? How do archaeologists use digital technologies on site, in the lab, or on the web? This course explores the intersection of digital technologies and computing with archaeology. We will explore the ways theory gets embedded into computation; perhaps there is even a theory of digital archaeology? We will explore how digital technologies allow us to ask questions that would otherwise be impossible to ask. We will consider the ethical ramifications of our digital tools and opaque algorithms. We will also look into the ways that computational creativity in archaeology allow for novel engagements with the past, thus moving us into a digital _public_ archaeology.

**You do not need to be 'techy' to be successful in this course! You just need to be diligent, honest, and open.**

You will read, watch, listen to, and discuss the class materials via various online tools including [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is) and [Github](http://github.com) (Speaking of Hypothes.is, highlight a word on this page and see what happens). We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead. Successful completion of this class involves doing a series of exercises each week designed to push you out of your comfort zone, AND to be a collegial and generous scholar engaging with, and helping your peers to achieve success. What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go. Thus open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked, is a meaningful aspect of this course. **Again: You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.**

## The Most Important Idea

Archaeology's genesis was in racism, and colonialism.

Digital technology's birth was in the violence of war, and the control of systems.

If you put those two things together _without taking into account the implications_ then we're in for a lot of trouble.

So what I want to know is, can digital archaeology be taught, be learned, be practiced, in such a way that we unpick those two trajectories, those two monstrous births, and use digital archaeology to better understand communities, empower people, and give better, more compelling, more truthful stories about what it means to be human?

Archaeology isn't necessarily about the past. It's about the materiality of the past _and present_ and in many ways, the future. We try to understand what it is to be human through the extended abilities that tool use, that objects and their agencies, give to us. The digital tools we use and are entangled with extend humanity in powerful ways - and in 2020, it's easy to see how digital technologies have extended humanity's worst impulses.

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
My goal here is to teach you to use certain digital techs; to unpack and interrogate those techs you learn to use; and to equip you to use these things in a reflective manner. It's about archaeology using computation; but also, looking at computation from an archaeological perspective.

It's going to be uncomfortable. Not only that, this is the first iteration of the course. That makes you my _accomplices_. There will be things we try here that will not work. That's why part of the exit ticket for this course will be for you to rethink the one part of the course that was _most affecting_ for you to make it better, but also, to think through who it might _harm_.

## Text/Tech
To the best of my ability, all materials will either be open access materials on the web or materials made available to us through MacOdrum Library or the University. You will not be required to purchase any set text or software.

We will be using elements of the Open Digital Archaeology Textbook Environment https://o-date.github.io; we may in fact re-write parts of it as a result of our work, in which case you will be credited as a co-author.

Having a reasonably up-to-date computer will make life easier for you; if you use a chromebook or a low-powered laptop (eg, less than 8 gb of RAM), this will require us to think creatively about some of the work, but should not present an insurmountable obstacle. A good internet connection will make life easier, but I realize that not everyone is well-served by our tech oligopolies. **Please let me know if these situations apply to you** so that we can work out a suitable plan of action.

## Class format
This class will be delivered online, asynchronously. A Discord server will be used to provide a social context to our work, for help, and for collaboration. Learning materials will be curated on this open course website, and might include a variety of modalities. **There will be no required synchronous chats or lectures.** Students will maintain course research notebooks on the web (which may be anonymous or pseudonymous or made private provided access is shared with me).
