Dr. Graham can be found online at

shawn dot graham at carleton dot ca

or on Twitter at [@electricarchae](http://twitter.com/electricarchaeo).

He will be present in our class discord server every day.

If we ever get out of quarantine, and you're in Ottawa, he often haunts the Library coffeeshop.

### Online Office Hours  

Dr. Graham will be present in our [Discord server](/week/1/discord) every Wednesday from 1 until 3, and quite possibly the evenings too.
