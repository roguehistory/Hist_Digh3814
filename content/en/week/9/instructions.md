## Communicating Digital Archaeology

### Goals for this week

- explore how archaeologists communicate digital archaeology professionally
- reuse archaeological data from a research compendium

### Listen

[Feed for the podcast here.](https://anchor.fm/s/1c3d3bfc/podcast/rss)

### Read

+ ‘The Numbers Don’t Speak for Themselves’ Draft chapter from Data Feminism by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein [link](https://bookbook.pubpub.org/pub/6ui5n4vo/release/4)
+ Ben Marwick, Carl Boettiger & Lincoln Mullen. 2018. Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly Using R (and Friends), The American Statistician, 72:1, 80-88, [link](http://faculty.washington.edu/bmarwick/PDFs/Marwick-Boettiger-Mullen-2018-TAS-research-compendia.pdf)
+ Perry, Sara, Roussou, Maria, Mirashrafi, Sophia S., Katifori, A., and McKinney, Sierra. 2019. Shared digital experiences supporting collaborative meaning-making at heritage sites. In Hannah Lewi, Wally Smith, Dirk vom Lehn, Steven Cooke (eds.), The Routledge International Handbook of New Digital Practices in Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums and Heritage Sites. London: Routledge. Pp. 143-156. [link](data/Perry.et.al.2019_SharedDigitalExperiences_PrePrint_FINAL.pdf)

Each reading is 'seeded' with annotations by me; some of my annotations contain video from me directing you to pay attention to particular issues or ideas. **Annotate** anything interesting you find with Hypothes.is while logged into our reading group, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read.

A good annotation draws connections between what you've read and other things you've read/heard/experienced. I explicitly encourage you to connect what you read in this class with what you're reading/doing in other classes. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.


### Do

_I do not necessarily expect you to complete all of these, because you are all coming to this class with different levels of digital ability. These are listed in order of difficulty. Push yourself until you get stumped._

- [Archaeology Data Service, how it makes data available, and a simple bit of code for getting that data into R](/week/9/ads)
- [Replicating others' research, and research compendia](/week/9/replication)
- [Archaeologists teaching other archaeologists code](/week/9/archaes-teaching-archaes)
- Explore some archaeological projects on [Open Context](https://opencontext.org/projects-search/) and see if you can download a csv of a project's data. (See also [their 'data' recipes](https://opencontext.org/about/recipes)). Using what you know about R, use our [R Studio in the cloud](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/o-date/r-conda/master?urlpath=rstudio) to load the data in, and make some simple visualizations.


{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
{{< /notice >}}

### Record and Reflect

1. As you did for week one, make another notes.md entry and put it in your private github repository for week 9.

2. I am willing to bet that the idea of 'replication' has never cropped up in any of your other history or GRS classes. I want you to reflect on the readings and your work this week in the context of those _other_ classes. What might all of this imply for you as history or humanities students? Discuss this in the context of your wins/fails for this week. Begin the reflection by quoting (w/ citation) one sentence from the readings that resonates with you: you don't have to explain why, but you might select something that is personally meaningful, or leaves you confused, or makes you happy, or intrigues you to know more... etc. Put your journal entry in your repo.

### Log Your Work

You can log the link to your work on [this form](https://forms.gle/9BMvFeFda9qq36fAA). **Make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it. (See the [Github instructions](/week/1/github) for a reminder.)
