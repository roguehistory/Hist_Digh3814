the saa2017 package too: let them load this up and explore: another example of archaeologists communicating (note the packages that have to be installed; use the install button)

they don't have to complete all the stuff in this one, but there are enough examples in this to keep them going forever.

have them use something from in here on graveyards data.


or at least, identify something they'd like to use on graveyards data once they figure things out (in the install_packages folder there's basic_gis_not_using_sf that has point pattern analysis in it that might be useful, although might not be able to install in our virtual machine)

added sf and spatstat. try again in the morning.

do the git clone thing. then can click on the rproject file, then the r file, and the working directory etc will be done.
