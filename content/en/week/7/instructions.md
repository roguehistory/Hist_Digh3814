## Futures of Digital Archaeology

### Goals for this week

- Try your hand at building an image classifier
- Simulate the Roman economy
- Raise the ghost of Rudolpho Lanciani
- Situate this work in an understanding of the potential futures for digital archaeology, but also in the context of current work in archaeology.

Each reading is 'seeded' with annotations by me; some of my annotations contain video from me directing you to pay attention to particular issues or ideas. **Annotate** anything interesting you find with Hypothes.is while logged into our reading group, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read.

A good annotation draws connections between what you've read and other things you've read/heard/experienced. I explicitly encourage you to connect what you read in this class with what you're reading/doing in other classes. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.

### Do

_I do not necessarily expect you to complete all of these, because you are all coming to this class with different levels of digital ability. These are listed in order of difficulty. Push yourself until you get stumped._

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.

### Record and Reflect

1. As you did for week one, make another notes.md entry and put it in your private github repository for week 7.

2. In your reflective journal, drawing on your annotations of what you've read, your notes from what you've listened to, and the work you've done (both the successes and the not-quite-successes) discuss the potential for these 'future archaeologies' to be unethical, alienating, or, conversely, _liberating_ or powerful new lenses for understanding humanity. Begin the reflection by quoting (w/ citation) one sentence from the readings that resonates with you: you don't have to explain why, but you might select something that is personally meaningful, or leaves you confused, or makes you happy, or intrigues you to know more... etc. Put your journal entry in your repo.

### Log Your Work

You can log the link to your work on [this form](https://forms.gle/9BMvFeFda9qq36fAA). **Make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it. (See the [Github instructions](/week/1/github) for a reminder.)
