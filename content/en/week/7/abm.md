1. Read [ODATE 4.4 - 4.4.1.3](https://o-date.github.io/draft/book/artificial-intelligence-in-digital-archaeology.html#agent-based-modeling-abm) (just the opening two sections)

2. Download and [install Netlogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) for your machine (there is an option called 'Netlogo Web', which runs in your browser. You can give that a shot, but I know that the bits below work on the desktop version. I haven't tested on the web version.)

- Option A: Follow along in Chapter 1 of the Romanowska, Wren, & Crabtree book, and build the model of [the out-of-Africa dispersal of modern humans](https://santafe.app.box.com/file/839105332240?s=2vw5aizqmcvwnrg8tack7aovwpcoabci); the code repo is at [github](https://github.com/SantaFeInstitute/ABMA/tree/master/ch1). (You can get the full book & all the code, if you're interested, at [https://santafeinstitute.github.io/ABMA/](https://santafeinstitute.github.io/ABMA/))

- Option B: Tom Brughmans has an _excellent_ tutorial that builds a simulation on top of the [Stanford ORBIS model](http://orbis.stanford.edu/): https://archaeologicalnetworks.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/netlogo_network-structures_v0-1.pdf The model can be downloaded at: https://www.comses.net/codebases/92b5dc6c-a124-4647-91d4-e7365264eac8/releases/1.0.0/ but do try to build your own version following the tutorial.

ORBIS network data is at https://purl.stanford.edu/mn425tz9757

I used to also give my own tutorial as an option here, but frankly, Romanowska, Wren, & Crabtree's volume is the _best_ guide out there now, so I only provide the links below for those who are interested:

> I wrote a guide to getting started with Netlogo that simulates trading pottery around a network, here: https://digitalarchaeology.berghahnbooks.com/digital-projects/an-enchantment-of-digital-archaeology/appendix-a/ . (The full code is [here, as 'pot_trade_model_code.nlogo'](https://github.com/Berghahn-DigitalArchaeology/An-Enchantment-of-Digital-Archaeology) but you'll still need to read the walkthrough. Incidentally, that link takes you to the Github repo for my publisher; you can take a copy of _all_ that code by going there and then hitting the 'fork' button.)
