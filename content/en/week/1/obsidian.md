## Notes and Emergent Ideas

In recent years, I've found that a lot of my research materials are all online. Everything I read, everything I study. I use [Zotero](https://zotero.org) to handle bibliography _and_ to push pdfs to an iPad with [zotfile](http://zotfile.com/); then I annotate as I read on the device, and eventually, retrieve the annotations back into Zotero.

I read on a browser on my work computer too; I use [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) with a private group where I'm the only member to annotate websites and pdfs when I can't be bothered to send them to the ipad.

I use a notebook where I scribble out ideas and page numbers.

All of this material is scattered around. I've long admired the work of Caleb McDaniel, and his [open notebook history](http://wcaleb.org/blog/open-notebook-history). His research lives online, in a kind of wiki. Links between ideas and observations can be made that way and eventually, ideas can emerge _out of the notes themselves_ by virtue of the way they're connected. This is the idea behind what is called the [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) ('slip box', where each idea, each observation is kept on a discrete slip of paper numbered in such a way that connections can be formed):

> A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.

On a computer, such a thing can be created out of a folder of simple text files. Everything I observe, every idea that I have: one idea, one file. Then I use the free 'second brain' software, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to sit 'on top' of that stack of files to enable easy linking and discoverability.

**The point** of using Obsidian in this course is that it will enable you to pull your hypothesis annotations together with all of the notes you take as you progress through this course. The key feature of Obsidian is the idea of linking ideas together: it's very much like a personal wiki. The more notes you make, the more connections you start to see, the deeper your learning and engagement with the material.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} You will notice throughout the weeks I talk about putting something into your journal; this is the tool that you will use for that. You may also use this tool for your consolidation documents.

1. Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

2. Then download and unzip my [Digiarch Lab Notebook](https://github.com/shawngraham/obsidian-dh-lab-notebook). A 'vault' is just a folder where your notes are found. Put this somewhere sensible on your computer.

3. Open Obsidian, and explore the default 'help' vault. An important thing to know: the notes are all written in markdown, but somethings you have to hit the note 'preview' button to see what's going on. Hit the note's 'pencil' icon to get back to editing. The 'help' vault will give you a sense of how Obsidian works.

4. When you're familiar with the interface, click the vault icon to open a new vault; find and select the 'Digiarch Lab Notebook'.

5. When the warning popup about community plugins & safe mode appears, turn safe mode OFF.

6. This vault is configured with some simple templates for fetching and turning Hypothesis web/pdf annotations into notes, and for making log files to help with the digital tutorials for this course. As you try the various tutorials in this class, you can also keep notes via Obsidian's 'daily note' feature; this might be handy! Hit the 'view daily note' button in the toolbar to make your first note. This can be just a simple 'hey, this is a note'.

7. Make a new github repository _just_ for your Digiarch Lab Notebook; configure it with a readme (if you make it _private_ you'll please add me as a collaborator). Once it's created, drag and drop _all_ the files from your vault into the repository. Commit your changes.

8. Notice once it finishes uploading that you can find the daily note you just created. Whenever I ask, for the duration of the course, for a journal entry, you can make it in Obsidian, upload your updated vault, and provide me the link to the file.   





(A vault with many more bells-and-whistles crafted especially for history students is available [here](https://github.com/shawngraham/obsidian-student-starter-vault) and you're welcome to give it a try too. This 'vault' is configured with plugins to make it easy to import zotero notes and bibliography. It has a template to go out and grab your hypothesis annotations. It has a template to create timelines from notes that detail events. If you drop an image file into the vault, it has a template to do OCR on that image and paste the resulting text into a new note. There are tools in there to help you find connections between your notes; one of them will examine your note and then use some text analysis to find related notes based on the text.)
