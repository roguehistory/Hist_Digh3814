### Goals for this week

- getting our Github accounts set up and making our first log entries
- getting Hypothes.is set up
- getting Zotero installed
- getting a sense of what digital archaeology is; also, 'failing gloriously'

### Listen

[Feed for the podcast here.]() _Podcast episodes will be updated once they're created. These are not 'lectures' per se, but me sitting down beside you to help you get to grips with each week's materials. Sometimes they will include discussion with other archaeologists..._

Each reading is 'seeded' with annotations by me; some of my annotations contain video from me directing you to pay attention to particular issues or ideas. **Annotate** anything interesting you find with Hypothes.is while logged into our reading group, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read. As a reminder, the invitation to join our reading group is [here](https://hypothes.is/groups/9jqiPzjR/hist3000-clcv3000).

A good annotation draws connections between what you've read and other things you've read/heard/experienced. I explicitly encourage you to connect what you read in this class with what you're reading/doing in other classes. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.


### Do

- Follow the instructions for [Setting Up Github](/week/1/github), [Setting up Hypothesis](/week/1/hypothesis), [Setting up Zotero](/week/1/zotero), and [asking for help](/week/1/help). You should read the [discord page](/week/1/discord) if you're new to that platform.
- Log your reflection in your appropriate github repository

- When/if you run into trouble, take screenshots (google how to do that for your particular machine) and these can be uploaded into your repository as well. Indeed, you should also keep track of any files you create as part of your weekly work in your repo: these are evidence!

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
{{< /notice >}}

### Record and Reflect

1. Being a digital archaeologist means keeping track of what you’ve done, as a gift to your future self (ie, so that when you come back to something, you can pick up where you left off). Make a new text document, and put into it any new terms you’ve encountered, commands you used, error messages you encountered, websites that helped, and so on: this document is a lab notebook, as it were. Bullet points and memos-to-self are fine. Put this text document into your private week one repo on github, along with any other files or digital things you happen to make. Call it your ‘notes.md’.

2. In a new text document, jot down some reflections -narrative, or bullet points, both are fine. Call it ‘journal.md’ This document also goes into your private week one repo on github. Detail any issues you had with getting started, any parts that caused you difficulty. If you got any error messages while trying to get set up, copy those into your reflection; google them. Do you find any websites that help you? What kind of ‘failures’ might you have encountered this week?

Drawing on your annotations of what you’ve read (and/or your notes from what you’ve listened to), discuss your idea of what ‘digital archaeology' might be prior to starting this course, and think through whether any of the materials we’ve seen this week confirm or upset those notions. What kind of archaeology have you encountered so far at Carleton, if at all? Where do you want to go, with digital archaeology?

### Log Your Work

You can log the link to your private repository on [this form](#). **Make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it. (See the [Github instructions](/week/1/github) for a reminder.)
