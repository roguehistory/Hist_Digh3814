### Introduction

Humans have made virtual worlds since time immemorial (see, for instance, [Lascaux](https://archeologie.culture.fr/lascaux/en)). Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli was a virtual world. Disney World is a virtual world. _Online is a virtual world but it's still the real world_.

As this map put together by Andrew Reinhard and I suggests, there are _a lot_ of dimensions to [archaeogaming](https://www.berghahnbooks.com/title/ReinhardArchaeogaming). I don't know if it's still on Netflix, but the ['Atari: Game Over' documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari:_Game_Over) is worth a look because it is a case of quite literal archaeology of video games.

Most of the time, no one excavates physical video games. But we do do work _inside_ video games, and archaeologists do sometimes _help design_ video games - Tara Copplestone, in ['Designing and Developing a Playful Past in Video Games'](https://interactivepasts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mol-et-al.-2017-The_Interactive_Past-E-book.pdf) has written on the tension between good archaeology and good game design, and it's well worth your time to read.

For my money, a video game does one thing really well: it teaches the player how to play it. **If you're really good at the game, you've internalized its representation of the world.** And that's why archaeologists need to think about storytelling, and ethics, and representation in video games. (More from me along this vein in [this article](https://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue55/2/full-text.html).)

But there are other ways of approaching the worlds created in video games as archaeological spaces. This week, I'll suggest three options.

### Option 1: Graves and memorialization in-world

Here, I want you to select a game that you know well that includes within it graveyards or other memorials to the dead. Off the top of my head, I could imagine Dwarf Fortress, Dragon Age Inquisition, Witcher, or the Assassins' Creed franchise. And then I want you to record gravestones and other monuments in the game, using our KoboToolBox recording system that we used for the Graveyard Project.

(This work is not without precedent; see the [archaeological survey of worlds in the No Man's Sky universe](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/blog/2019/09/no-mans-sky/); there was even a [code of ethics](https://archaeogaming.com/2016/07/15/no-mans-sky-archaeological-survey-code-of-ethics/) developed to guide that research.

**_But, but... games aren't real worlds! What good would it be to study memorialization in there?_**

Virtual worlds are still human worlds, and the way death is memorialized in there might also provide us insight to how we construct death _out here_. Archaeology isn't just about the past, remember. We spend a great deal of our waking hours in these virtual worlds. Perhaps studying memorialization in-world will give us insight into memorializations of the future? Perhaps it might tell us about how people form social relationships in-world? Let's find out.

Go into the game, and take screenshots. Then, working from your screenshots, [record them in our system](/week/2/do-the-project). Think about, and record, the ways memorialization is constructed in these games, and how it is similar/different from the 'real world' data.

### Option 2: Craft a 'barely' game

Rob MacDougall introduced me to the idea of ['barely games'](http://www.robmacdougall.org/blog/tag/games-and-gaming/) years ago. With this option, I want you to devise a 'barely game' that could be played with our [graveyards data](/data/graveyards-data.csv).

This is for the entirely practical reason that designing and building games takes a lot of time and effort. Thus, your game might -

- be built in [Twine](https://twinery.org); there are _many_ tutorials on how to achieve different effects with Twine; you might start with the [Twine Cookbook](https://twinery.org/cookbook/)
- be built with [Bitsy](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy)
- something else that you know of that I haven't encountered. Key thing is: this has to be something achievable in a few days.

### Option 3: Game Design Document

Another possibility is to _sketch out_ a game design document for something a *little* bit more complex than a barely game, but certainly not as complex as a first person shooter. Maybe a deck builder? Something where the main gameplay maps onto the ways digital arcaheology looks at the world. (templates abound online; [here's one](https://vitalzigns.itch.io/gdd)). I emphasize again: sketch. Focus on aesthetics and gameplay. Key element: it must use the information collected by this class.
