## Storytelling

### Goals for this week

- Last week was about getting your work out there. This week is about finding the compelling story, the enchanting story, the heart-centered work of archaeology.

Each reading is 'seeded' with annotations by me; some of my annotations contain video from me directing you to pay attention to particular issues or ideas. **Annotate** anything interesting you find with Hypothes.is while logged into our reading group, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read.

A good annotation draws connections between what you've read and other things you've read/heard/experienced. I explicitly encourage you to connect what you read in this class with what you're reading/doing in other classes. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.

### Do

- engage creatively with your data [to tell a compelling story](/week/11/creativity)
- try some [archaeogaming](/week/11/archaeogaming)

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
{{< /notice >}}

### Record and Reflect

1. As you did for week one, make another notes.md entry and put it in your private github repository for week 11.

2. In your reflective journal, drawing on your annotations of what you've read, your notes from what you've listened to, and the work you've done (both the successes and the not-quite-successes), discuss some ways in which a creative mindset might change what archaeology (or history for that matter) could be for you as a scholar. Put your journal in your repo.

### Log Your Work

You can submit the link to your work on [this form](#). **Make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it. (See the [Github instructions](/week/1/github) for a reminder.)
