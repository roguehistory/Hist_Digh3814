Each reading is 'seeded' with annotations by me; some of my annotations contain video from me directing you to pay attention to particular issues or ideas. **Annotate** anything interesting you find with Hypothes.is while logged into our reading group, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read.

A good annotation draws connections between what you've read and other things you've read/heard/experienced. I explicitly encourage you to connect what you read in this class with what you're reading/doing in other classes. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.


### Do

_Unlike in previous weeks, I really want you to do both of these. For the research compendium, you will need to pool resources with your peers; see the instructions._

- Explore, and participate, [in some crowd-sourced archaeology](/week/10/sharing-authority)
- Start to [build a research compendium](/week/10/start-compendium)
- Using what you know about public facing work in archaeology, build a [static website on github pages](/week/10/static-websites) explaining (and eventually, linking to) your research compendium and the work that you've done on the graveyards project.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
{{< /notice >}}

### Record and Reflect

1. As you did for week one, make another notes.md entry and put it in your private github repository for week 10.

2. In your reflective journal, drawing on your annotations of what you've read, your notes from what you've listened to, and the work you've done this week (both the successes and the not-quite-successes) discuss the work you've done so far in this class as a whole and what it might mean for the communities which your graveyards serve. Put your journal in your repo.

### Log Your Work

You can log the link to your work on [this form](https://forms.gle/9BMvFeFda9qq36fAA)
. **Make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it. (See the [Github instructions](/week/1/github) for a reminder.)
