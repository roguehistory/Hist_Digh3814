Each reading is 'seeded' with annotations by me; some of my annotations contain video from me directing you to pay attention to particular issues or ideas. **Annotate** anything interesting you find with Hypothes.is while logged into our reading group, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read.

A good annotation draws connections between what you've read and other things you've read/heard/experienced. I explicitly encourage you to connect what you read in this class with what you're reading/doing in other classes. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.


### Do

_Unlike in previous weeks, I really want you to do both of these. For the research compendium, you will need to pool resources with your peers; see the instructions._

- Explore, and participate, [in some crowd-sourced archaeology](/week/10/sharing-authority)
- Start to [build a research compendium](/week/10/start-compendium)

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
{{< /notice >}}

### Record and Reflect

1. As you did for week one, make another notes.md entry and put it in your private github repository for week 10.

2. TODO    . Put your journal entry in your repo.

Drawing on your annotations of what you've read (and/or your notes from what you've listened to), discuss ...
