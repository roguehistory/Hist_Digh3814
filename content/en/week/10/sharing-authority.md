Archaeologists have used digital media in a variety of ways to try to reach new audiences. I want you to explore the following sites and annotate what you find, using our hypothes.is reading group (**nb** don't use the 'public' group!), tying what you're seeing to ideas you encountered in the readings.

+ [https://www.dayofarchaeology.com/](https://www.dayofarchaeology.com/) (worldwide) and [Ben Marwick's Analysis of the posts](https://github.com/benmarwick/dayofarchaeology)
+ Archaeology in the Community (US) [http://www.archaeologyincommunity.com/](http://www.archaeologyincommunity.com/)
+ DigVentures (UK) [https://digventures.com/](https://digventures.com/)

Then, I want you to actually sign up and complete some of the possible 'citizen science' tasks at Micropasts  (UK) [https://crowdsourced.micropasts.org/](https://crowdsourced.micropasts.org/).

Connect what you do with what you've read and observed. How is archaeological expertise conveyed, shared, defended, or enlarged by these projects?
