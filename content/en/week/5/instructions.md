### Goals for this week

- recognize the strengths and weaknesses of our graveyard coding scheme
- uncover the ways in which 'counting' hides or highlights the past
- encounter CSVs, SQL, and R and how to do some basic statistics

### Listen

[Feed for the podcast here.]()

### Read

+ ‘What gets counted, counts’. Draft chapter from Data Feminism by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein [link](https://bookbook.pubpub.org/pub/rykaknh1/release/4)
+ Labrador, Angela. 2012. Ontologies of the Future and Interfaces for All: Archaeological Databases for the Twenty-First Century. Archaeologies 8,236–249 [link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11759-012-9203-2)
+ Cook, Katherine, et al. 2018.  Teaching Open Science: Published Data and Digital Literacy in Archaeology Classrooms. Advances in Archaeological Practice, 6.2,144-156 [link](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-archaeological-practice/article/teaching-open-science-published-data-and-digital-literacy-in-archaeology-classrooms/8404682E019727CCF43416B81E4E9092/core-reader)

Each reading is 'seeded' with annotations by me; some of my annotations contain video from me directing you to pay attention to particular issues or ideas. **Annotate** anything interesting you find with Hypothes.is while logged into our reading group, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read.

A good annotation draws connections between what you've read and other things you've read/heard/experienced. I explicitly encourage you to connect what you read in this class with what you're reading/doing in other classes. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.

### Do

_I do not necessarily expect you to complete all of these, because you are all coming to this class with different levels of digital ability. These are listed in order of difficulty. Push yourself until you get stumped._

- modify the existing scheme or suggest a new category that would address one of the shortcomings you identified in last week's Consolidation doc. You can use a wide variety of software to achieve this, but perhaps the simplest would be to open the code sheet pdf, take a screenshot, and then annotate it with your machine's drawing tools. Embed this in a .md file in your repository, with whatever explanatory info you need.
- Explore [basic statistics in R on archaeological data](week/5/basic-r-stats) and work through it.

- Enjoy [a gentle introduction to databases](/week/5/databases).

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
{{< /notice >}}

### Record and Reflect

1. Log your process in your private github repository.

2. In your reflective journal, drawing on your annotations of what you've read, your notes from what you've listened to, and the work you've done (both the successes and the not-quite-successes) discuss the space between the action of counting, and the reality of the things that have been counted. In what ways does the coding scheme from [DEBS](https://debs.ac.uk) miss, elide, or highlight memorialization practice in Canadian graveyards? If you were able to get our data into a notebook and begin examining it, what patterns emerge and what do they suggest (given what you've read this week)?

### Log You Work

You can log the link to your work on [this form](#). **Make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it. (See the [Github instructions](/week/1/github) for a reminder.)
