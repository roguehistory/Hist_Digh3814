R is a programming language for statistics that is used frequently by archaeologists (the other popular option is Python). One of the advantages of _scripting_ or writing out your analysis as a sequence of commands is that anyone can look at your code and understand what you did and why it worked.

1. Launch a virtual computer running RStudio in your browser by right-clicking on <a href="http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/o-date/r-conda/master?urlpath=rstudio" target="_blank">this link</a>

2. The interface for RStudio looks like this:

![rstudio](/images/rstudio/rstudio1.png)

3. Create a new script:

![create script](/images/rstudio/rstudio2.png)

![ta da](/images/rstudio/rstudio3.png)

4. The script that you want can be found [at this link](/data/archdata.R). Open the link in a new tab, and then copy it into the script window in R Studio. Put the cursor at the top of the file at the start of the line. You can then run each line by hitting the 'run' button, or by using the keyboard shortcut (cmd+enter or shift+enter). Read the comments (which are marked with a `#` sign) and follow all instructions.

5. Going further: Try Kevin Gartski's tutorial on visualizing archaeological data [here](https://github.com/kgarstki/ANTH-641-Week-9/blob/master/Week9.R). You can copy and paste that code directly into a new script in R (click on the 'raw' button on github, then copy all the text, paste into the R script window).
