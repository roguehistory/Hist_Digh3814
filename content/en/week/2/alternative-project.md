### Virtual Worlds

Humans have made virtual worlds since time immemorial (see, for instance, [Lascaux](https://archeologie.culture.fr/lascaux/en)). Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli was a virtual world. Disney World is a virtual world. _Online is a virtual world but it's still the real world_.

For this alternative project, you have two choices, and they both involve different kinds of virtuality. One is a bit more... _out there_ than the other, but both are valuable:

1. The Archaeogaming Grave Project.
2. The Findagrave.com Grave Project.

For both of these options, I still want you to use the same [recording framework](/week/2/kobotoolbox) as the main project. In subsequent weeks, you'll read the main instructions and just adapt/adopt accordingly - you will want to consult with other students who are trying the same thing, and with me. There will be situations where this is easy; there will be situations where this is hard; there will be situations where it all breaks.

**That's OK**

In essence, the only difference between the 'main' project and these two alternatives is the _site_ of your research.

## The Findagrave.com Grave Project

Here, I want you to use [findagrave.com](https://findagrave.com) to locate historical graveyards near you. I want you to work from the photographs of stones.

## The Archaeogaming Grave Project

Here, I want you to select a game that you know well that includes within it graveyards or other memorials to the dead. Off the top of my head, I could imagine Dwarf Fortress, Dragon Age Inquisition, Witcher, or the Assassins' Creed franchise.

(This work is not without precedent; google the work of 'Andrew Reinhard archaeogaming'; see the [code of ethics](https://archaeogaming.com/2016/07/15/no-mans-sky-archaeological-survey-code-of-ethics/) developed to [survey new worlds in No Man's Sky](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/blog/2019/09/no-mans-sky/).

**_But, but... games aren't real worlds! What good would it be to study memorialization in there?_**

Virtual worlds are still human worlds, and the way death is memorialized in there might also provide us insight to how we construct death _out here_. Archaeology isn't just about the past, remember. We spend a great deal of our waking hours in these virtual worlds. Perhaps studying memorialization in-world will give us insight into memorializations of the future? Perhaps it might tell us about how people form social relationships in-world? Let's find out.
