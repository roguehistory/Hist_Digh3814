It may be that it is not feasible for you to go out into your community and visit a local graveyard for the purposes of this course. If this is you, please just send me a note saying that you'll be doing the alternative. I don't need a reason why; I can imagine several different scenarios where an alternative might be necessary, so we'll roll with it.

The alternatives I've crafted below might cause us hiccups and roadblocks or other unforseen difficulties. **That's OK**. No archaeological project ever goes off perfectly without a hitch. Adapting and working through the consequences is part of the point.

### Virtual Worlds

Humans have made virtual worlds since time immemorial (see, for instance, [Lascaux](https://archeologie.culture.fr/lascaux/en)). Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli was a virtual world. Disney World is a virtual world. _Online is a virtual world but it's still the real world_.

For this alternative project, you have two choices, and they both involve different kinds of virtuality. One is a bit more... _out there_ than the other, but both are valuable:

1. The Archaeogaming Grave Project.
2. The Findagrave.com Grave Project.

For both of these options, I still want you to use the same [recording framework](/week/2/kobotoolbox) as the main project. In subsequent weeks, you'll read the main instructions and just adapt/adopt accordingly - you will want to consult with other students who are trying the same thing, and with me. There will be situations where this is easy; there will be situations where this is hard; there will be situations where it all breaks.

**That's OK**

In essence, the only difference between the 'main' project and these two alternatives is the _site_ of your research.

## The Findagrave.com Grave Project

Here, I want you to use [findagrave.com](https://findagrave.com) to locate historical graveyards near you. Find some, and save the photographs to your own machine (right-click on a photo, 'save as'). I want you to work from the photographs of stones and [record them in our system](/week/2/do-the-project). In this way, we bring the site to you.

## The Archaeogaming Grave Project

Here, I want you to select a game that you know well that includes within it graveyards or other memorials to the dead. Off the top of my head, I could imagine Dwarf Fortress, Dragon Age Inquisition, Witcher, or the Assassins' Creed franchise.

(This work is not without precedent; google the work of 'Andrew Reinhard archaeogaming'; see the [code of ethics](https://archaeogaming.com/2016/07/15/no-mans-sky-archaeological-survey-code-of-ethics/) developed to [survey new worlds in No Man's Sky](https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/blog/2019/09/no-mans-sky/).

**_But, but... games aren't real worlds! What good would it be to study memorialization in there?_**

Virtual worlds are still human worlds, and the way death is memorialized in there might also provide us insight to how we construct death _out here_. Archaeology isn't just about the past, remember. We spend a great deal of our waking hours in these virtual worlds. Perhaps studying memorialization in-world will give us insight into memorializations of the future? Perhaps it might tell us about how people form social relationships in-world? Let's find out.

Go into the game, and take screenshots. Then, working from your screenshots, [record them in our system](/week/2/do-the-project).
