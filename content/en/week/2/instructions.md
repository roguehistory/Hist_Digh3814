Each reading is 'seeded' with annotations by me; some of my annotations contain video from me directing you to pay attention to particular issues or ideas. **Annotate** anything interesting you find with Hypothes.is while logged into our reading group, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read.

A good annotation draws connections between what you've read and other things you've read/heard/experienced. I explicitly encourage you to connect what you read in this class with what you're reading/doing in other classes. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.

### Do

This week and next you will head out into your local community to map a historical graveyard, and record some gravestones, using a digital recording tool called 'Kobo Toolbox'.

- Follow [these instructions on working safely](/week/2/safework.md)
- Make a sketch map of the graveyard [following these suggestions](/week/2/sketchmap.md); you'll turn this into a digital map next week
- Begin recording using the [kobotoolbox forms](/week/2/kobotoolbox.md)

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.

### Record and Reflect

1. Log your process in your private github repository

2. In your reflective journal, drawing on your annotations of what you've read, your notes from what you've listened to, and the work you've done (both the successes and the not-quite-successes) discuss the ethical issues that this week's work presents to you as you go out into your community. Are there ethical or physical dangers for you? What are the challenges for doing digital archaeology in your own particular context? How does the work I am asking you to do present ethical or moral challenges for your community?

### Log Your Work

You can submit the link to your work on [this form](#). **Make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it. (See the [Github instructions](/week/1/github) for a reminder.)
