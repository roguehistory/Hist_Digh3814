Each reading is 'seeded' with annotations by me; some of my annotations contain video from me directing you to pay attention to particular issues or ideas. **Annotate** anything interesting you find with Hypothes.is while logged into our reading group, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read.

A good annotation draws connections between what you've read and other things you've read/heard/experienced. I explicitly encourage you to connect what you read in this class with what you're reading/doing in other classes. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.

### Do

This week and next you will head out into your local community to map a historical graveyard, and record some gravestones, using a digital recording tool called 'Kobo Toolbox'.

- Make sure you understand the [rationale for why we're doing this](/week/2/rationale)
- Follow [these instructions on working safely](/week/2/safework)
- Make a sketch map of the graveyard [following these suggestions](/week/2/sketchmap); you'll turn this into a digital map next week
- Begin recording using the [kobotoolbox forms](/week/2/do-the-project)
- There is an [alternative project](/week/2/alternative-project) if it is not feasible to go out into your community

Talk to each other. For instance, you might want to share photos of what you're doing in the Discord server to ask others what they think of a particular grave monument, how they might code it in our system. I am not trying to catch-you-out, so it is ok to admit that you're not entirely sure about something: archaeology is social. We're all on the same team.

### Record and Reflect

1. As you did for week one, make another notes.md entry and put it in your private github repository for week 2.

2. In your reflective journal, drawing on your annotations of what you've read, your notes from what you've listened to, and the work you've done (both the successes and the not-quite-successes) discuss the ethical issues that this week's work presents to you as you go out into your community. Are there ethical or physical dangers for you? What are the challenges for doing digital archaeology in your own particular context? How does the work I am asking you to do present ethical or moral challenges for your community? Begin the reflection by quoting (w/ citation) one sentence from the readings that resonates with you: you don't have to explain why, but you might select something that is personally meaningful, or leaves you confused, or makes you happy, or intrigues you to know more... etc. Put your journal entry in your repo.

### Log Your Work

You can log the link to your work on [this form](https://forms.gle/9BMvFeFda9qq36fAA). **Make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it. (See the [Github instructions](/week/1/github) for a reminder.)
