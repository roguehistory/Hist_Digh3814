## The Last Bit

The last bit of the course is the **Exit Ticket**.

## Listen

[Feed for the podcast here.](https://anchor.fm/s/1c3d3bfc/podcast/rss)

### Do

The format of the exit ticket is up to you. You will craft a statement reflecting on where you started and where you’ve gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you’ve done against the [learning outcomes](/docs/2-learning-outcomes) by reference to evidence in your repo, things you've read, things you've written. In essence, you're making the case to me now for what you understand _your_ Digital Archaeology to be. You may, if you wish, indicate what you think your letter grade ought to be, and why.

This isn't a long document|piece of media. You can, in a way, consider it a consolidation of your three Consolidation Docs (and you may freely draw on those docs, to make it).

### Submit work

You can submit the link to your work on [this form](https://forms.gle/9BMvFeFda9qq36fAA). **Make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it. (See the [Github instructions](/week/1/github) for a reminder.)

### Celebrate

This hasn't been - I'll wager - an easy journey for you. But it will pay you back. I promise. Thank you for joining me! Good luck on your exams, and I hope to see you face to face in my classroom next year.
