## The Contexts of Digital and Other Archaeologies

### Goals for this week

- Explore some of the literature of archaeology using a macroscopic point of view
- Understand the social context of archaeological practice
- Identify the antecedents to digital archaeology in the broader literature

Each reading is 'seeded' with annotations by me; some of my annotations contain video from me directing you to pay attention to particular issues or ideas. **Annotate** anything interesting you find with Hypothes.is while logged into our reading group, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read.

A good annotation draws connections between what you've read and other things you've read/heard/experienced. I explicitly encourage you to connect what you read in this class with what you're reading/doing in other classes. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.


### Do

- A few years ago I created a [topic model](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet#what-is-topic-modeling-and-for-whom-is-this-useful) of 20 000 archaeological articles from 1935 to 2010-ish. I want you to [explore it here](https://shawngraham.github.io/archae-topic-models/20000/#). Each of the bubbles is a 'topic'; if you click on 'years' you'll see a 'stream graph', or the proportion each topic accounts for that year's total archaeological writing output (in English speaking journals). Notice the inflection points? What was going on in the world at those points? (Remember there's a lag between work being done, and work being published). What other patterns do you notice? Are there topics that perhaps relate to the themes of this course? In what journals? By what authors?
- [World Archaeology](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&journalCode=rwar20) tries to be a much more ...global... journal. It's not included in the 20 000 topic model. Here's another [topic model just for this particular journal](http://graeworks.net/digitalarchae/wa/#). Explore, and contrast this with the previous.
- You can continue to try the exercises from last week as well.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.

### Record and Reflect

1. As you did for week one, make another notes.md entry and put it in your private github repository for week 6.

2. In your reflective journal, drawing on your annotations of what you've read, your notes from what you've listened to, and the work you've done (both the successes and the not-quite-successes) discuss what you have observed from the topic models (and what you did last week) in the context of what you have read this week. Can you identify issues or trends that make you hopeful for the discipline? How do our course materials stack up - is there something that needs changing? Maybe it's something that I can change **right now**, and if that's the case, then I need to know. Put your journal entry in your repo.

### Log Your Work

You can log the link to your work on [this form](https://forms.gle/9BMvFeFda9qq36fAA). **Make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it. (See the [Github instructions](/week/1/github) for a reminder.)
