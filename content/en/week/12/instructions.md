## Consolidation Pause III

### Goals for this week

- Use this time to catch up on anything you didn't read, to try some of the exercises over again, and to consolidate what you've achieved so far.

### Listen

No episode this week. But you can get the [feed for the podcast here.](https://anchor.fm/s/1c3d3bfc/podcast/rss)

### Do

You may make your repository private **or** public.

If you make it private, **make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it. (See the [Github instructions](/week/1/github) for a reminder.)

- Create a short consolidation document that reflects on this third module and your growth (one or two pages is fine). Feel free to build it from what you've already written in your logs.

Discuss _at least_ one 'fail' and one 'win'. Explicitly situate your discussion with reference to the readings and annotations by the class as a whole. Again, as I asked at the end of Modules 1 and 2, in the context of the last few weeks, what has been most challenging win/fail for you, and why is that?

Given what you've read and explored in this last module, which was about 'communicating' digital archaeology, what are the implications for 'doing' digital archaeology for different audiences? How has your thinking evolved since the end of Module 2? Are there new dilemmas that have emerged?

Integrate my feedback on your earlier work or any feedback you have received from your peers, summarizing the work you have done to date.

- Upload this to your github repository.

### Submit Work for Grading

You can log the link to your repository on [this form](https://forms.gle/9BMvFeFda9qq36fAA).

## A Choice re Consolidation III and the Exit Ticket

Recognizing the grind that we are all in as the term winds down, and knowing that Covid-19 is still a factor in our lives, I've decided that we can afford a choice as we hurtle towards the end of term.

There are two graded assignments left - consolidation doc III and the [exit ticket](https://digiarch.netlify.app/week/12-5/instructions/). Of these, the exit ticket is imagined as a kind of consolidation of the consolidations, and a chance for you to argue for a final grade if you so desire to do (perhaps sickness or other issues meant that your earlier work doesn't accurately reflect what you've learned, etc). Those two documents are each worth 25% of your final grade.

Here's what I'm thinking:

**Option A**: you complete the consolidation doc III AND the Exit Ticket as laid out in the syllabus. 25% and 25%. Consolidation doc III is due at the end of week 12; the exit ticket will be due at the end of the following week.

**Option B**: you complete JUST the consolidation doc III addressing the prompts as fully and explicitly as you can AND you add a section discussing the overall evolution of your thought in the course (with explicit reference to your earlier work, links, and citations to readings as appropriate). If you choose this option, the weightings of your three consolidation documents will be 33 1/3% each, **and the ability to argue for your own overall grade in the course will be off the table.** I will accept Option B work as late as December 17.

You will indicate which option you are pursuing with a statement in the first line of Consolidation Doc III.
