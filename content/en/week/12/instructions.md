## Consolidation Pause III

### Goals for this week

- Use this time to catch up on anything you didn't read, to try some of the exercises over again, and to consolidate what you've achieved so far.

### Listen

No episode this week. But you can get the [feed for the podcast here.](https://anchor.fm/s/1c3d3bfc/podcast/rss)

### Do

- Create a short consolidation document that reflects on this third module and your growth (one or two pages is fine). Feel free to build it from what you've already written in your logs.

Discuss _at least_ one 'fail' and one 'win'. Explicitly situate your discussion with reference to the readings and annotations by the class as a whole. Again, as I asked at the end of Modules 1 and 2, in the context of the last few weeks, what has been most challenging win/fail for you, and why is that?

Given what you've read and explored in this last module, which was about 'communicating' digital archaeology, what are the implications for 'doing' digital archaeology for different audiences? How has your thinking evolved since the end of Module 2? Are there new dilemmas that have emerged?

Integrate my feedback on your earlier work or any feedback you have received from your peers, summarizing the work you have done to date.
- Upload this to your private github repository.

### Submit Work for Grading

You can submit the link to your work on [this form](https://forms.gle/9BMvFeFda9qq36fAA). **Make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it. (See the [Github instructions](/week/1/github) for a reminder.)
