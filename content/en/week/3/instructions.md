Each reading is 'seeded' with annotations by me; some of my annotations contain video from me directing you to pay attention to particular issues or ideas. **Annotate** anything interesting you find with Hypothes.is while logged into our reading group, keeping in mind what you've already heard/read.

A good annotation draws connections between what you've read and other things you've read/heard/experienced. I explicitly encourage you to connect what you read in this class with what you're reading/doing in other classes. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.


### Do

- Continue to record your ten graves
- Create 3d models of some of the graves using [photogrammetry](photogrammetry.md)
- Create a webmap showing the location of the graveyard and its stones.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
{{< /notice >}}

### Record and Reflect

1. Log your process in your private github repository.

2. In your reflective journal, drawing on your annotations of what you've read, your notes from what you've listened to, and the work you've done (both the successes and the not-quite-successes) discuss your observations about the graveyard you are working on. Are there differences in who gets commemorated, and how? Were there aspects of the work that affected you emotionally? Why? Do the 3d models have an affective aura? Why or why not? In what ways does mapping the graveyard give you authority and power?

### Log Your Work

You can submit the link to your work on [this form](#). **Make sure to 'invite user shawngraham'** to your repository so that I may view it. (See the [Github instructions](/week/1/github) for a reminder.)
