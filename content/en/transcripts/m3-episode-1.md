Transcript of this week's podcast episode.

### Part One

We're now in the final third of this course, which I've called 'Communicating'. There are lots of different contexts in which we share archaeological data, and lots of different ways to achieve that. Lots of different 'publics', too!

In this week's materials, we're looking at the ways archaeologists inform each other about their work, share their data, and the 'open science' movement, which aims for both reproducibility and replicability. Reproducible research means that if I provide you my data and show you my analytical methods, you can arrive at the same results that I did; replicability means that you can use a different approach on different data to find the same observation (ie, if two different teams took different samples from the same wooden artefact and used different dating methods, they'd arrive at the same date.)

The idea that archaeological research could be reproducible or replicable is quite new in the discipline, and runs parallel with efforts to make archaeological work more widely available via things like 'open access publishing', making results and data free-to-read. Given that a lot of archaeological work is publicly funded, this only seems appropriate, but the publishing oligarchies have managed to pervert this by charging exorbitant 'article processing fees', and then selling access to the journals _anyway_ by bundling them with non OA-titles. But I digress.

I generally believe that making my research and my results open access is a moral imperative. But it's worth taking a moment and reflecting on what can happen when OA intersects the 'real world'. I want to tell you about what happened once when my own research escaped my control, which makes me wonder if there are situations where the greater good is served by _not_ making our work openly available.

Now remember, I became a digital archaeologist from necessity. If people shared data, I could pretend to myself that I was ‘doing’ archaeology! Open access was a lifeline. Playing, exploring, & building from other people’s data allowed me to re-invent myself, and I can trace a direct line from my current job to those days.

I’ve always felt then, aside from all the other arguments for open access, there was a moral imperative to pay it back. Right? I had benefited; now that I’m in a position to do it, I need to get my materials out there, in remembrance of the lost post-phd guy I was.

Fast-forward. I never set out to study the trade in human remains. But here I am, & we’ve been publishing in OA journals, making code and data freely available… Good, right? Well… here’s what happened.

In January of 2019, the faculty magazine did a piece on our ‘Bone Trade’ project, especially since it was all open access and the reporters could read our work.

That summer, a local journalist wanted to talk to me about the project, having seen that piece, and again, having read our work.

So far, so good! Everyone wants their research to attract some attention, right? The Citizen is part of the Postmedia group, so the story got taken up by various papers across Canada.

Then a political candidate bought a human skull as a gift for her boyfriend.

APTN, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, broke the story and asked me for comment, having seen the other newspaper articles, and again, having read our work. The APTN story was taken up by lots of other outlets, both in Canada and internationally. Suddenly, there were interview requests everywhere.

Our work even made it into Wired magazine (the politician did not). But, in trying to be ‘balanced’, it seems, the story included interviews w collectors. And they made the editorial decision to embed _in the story_ posts from Instagram selling human remains.

That story was picked up and re-worked across multiple outlets, including the Sun, Britain's biggest tabloid. But in that version, we’d been erased from the research, and the nuance we try for in our work is lost. But the collectors sure got a lot of oxygen!

A number of outlets contacted us, for interviews (including BBC), requesting that we also put them in touch with collectors. I refused to do this. If we were studying sex trafficking, would you ask us to put you in touch with pimps?

As our research got out there, we the researchers and our scholarly goals got gradually erased in favour of the sensational sound bites from the people doing the bone trading.

I know this is not a particularly egregious case; there are far worse out there. But we know that buyers/sellers of human remains are reading our work and adapting accordingly. With the press attention, and the celebration of the ‘eccentric’ collectors, how much traffic did we drive to collectors? To what degree did we help promote the trade we are studying? How have we changed their behaviour to _enhance_ their ability to trade without prying eyes?

These human remains were collected in morally, ethically, legally dubious circumstances. To reduce them to clickbait is to return us to the era of ‘human zoos’. How many times will these people be dehumanized? But… we published OA. We put our material out there.

It’s our fault, right? Publishing the work needs to be done openly, I thought, given how these remains were collected in the first place in secret. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, isn't it?

Maybe I was wrong.

But hiding the work behind paywalls is wrong, too. Publicly funded work should be accessible by the public (which publics, SG?). We didn’t conceive the project as ‘public archaeology’, but if we had we would not have gotten into this mess of inadvertently promoting sellers.

A month or two later, I returned to scraping Instagram, and I noticed new figures active, old figures gone, & maybe the internet’s short attention span had already taken care of the situation. Maybe I worry too much. But is this a case where OA is the wrong approach?

Or is the error: the attracting of attention, drawing the eye of a media ecosystem addicted to both-sides-ism, an ecosystem addled by ‘engagement’ mechanics predicated on outrage?

I know I conceived this project without thinking about how, if you study things online, things online have a way of pushing back.

The human remains trade in its origins is part of the literal flow of human bodies from around the world into the West. As Priscilla Ulguim reminds us, 'we are sometimes at risk of sharing information which isn't ours to share: to avoid this issue our stakeholders should be the people advising on ethical concerns and leading the process of opening our data.' OA assumes I have the right to share; but not always true & the contexts are complex.

I am also from the global north, the consumer of these bodies, of these data. Unthinking OA allows me to profit academically from these bodies one more time.

Before I was a prof, OA let me play at being an archaeologist. Now on the other side, I want to get my research out there: but naive OA, especially in archaeology, is not without its risks, as this summer has demonstrated. I need to do better.
