Transcript of this week's podcast episode.

### Part One

I wrote a book called 'Practical Necromancy'. Or rather, I _wanted_ to call it 'Practical Necromancy' but various folks felt that would be a bit off-putting. So instead, it ended up being called 'An Enchantment of Digital Archaeology: Raising the Dead through Agent Based Models, Archaeogaming, and Artificial Intelligence'. It came out this past summer. The key idea in it, which I learned from the work and writing of Sara Perry, is the idea of 'enchantment' as a mode of being open to the world. Why does this matter? Perry points out that a lot of archaeological work is driven by a crisis-mode vision of the world: everything is being destroyed, collect the archaeology before it's being gone. We'll worry about what it means later. Perry draws on the political theorist Jane Bennett who sees 'enchantment' as a way to foster ethical engagement and care for the wider world. In archaeological terms, Perry sees that archaeological materials are the eruption of deep time into our every day world and so offer the potential to enchant us. Therefore, she writes,

> **I believe archaeology can change the world for the better** through its inherent and highly distinctive capacity to generate wonder and enchantment among human beings.

Her advice to achieve enchantment is to 'deliberately weave **affective practices** into all aspects of our archaeological methodologies and project designs, therein offering us a more contextual and dynamic model for doing, recording, interpreting, publicising and archiving archaeology.'

For me, this was an exciting article (it's called 'The Enchantment of the Archaeological Record', and it was published in the European Journal of Archaeology. Look it up.). It was exciting because for many years I have been _disenchanted_ with archaeology. Disenchanted with how we do it, what we pay attention to, and how we write it, that faux-objective third person voice. I got into archaeology because it fired my imagination. It let me see through time! And then I graduated, and was unemployed/unemployable for 8 years.

For my book then, I wanted to examine what it was that I found enchanting about digital archaeology; and since this was a very personal perspective, it's 'an enchantment'. I wanted to examine what was affective about doing digital archaeology. For me, it comes down to relationships. I can see relationships between individuals in the distant past, even if I don't know who those individuals were. I can scale up those relationships, knitting them together into a network, and soon I can see the outlines of their social world. I can resurrect these networks in a simulation, and replay the past. Networks are capable of computation, and if treat for instance what someone wrote as a system of relationships (the probabilistic patterns of how they used words), I can resurrect their voice and have a conversation with them.

There's a lot more detail to it than that, but that's the gist of it. This week, I want you to feel something of that enchantment. The tasks all are facets of a kind of digital necromancy - not just raising the dead, but raising them to understand something of the culture they were once part of. You'll spot the idea of 'the network' in many different ways in this week's materials, whether it's a literal network, or whether it's a computational network that learns how to see.

But that's just one vision of the future of digital archaeology. The readings this week will give you other perspectives. Perhaps it's all just phygital.
