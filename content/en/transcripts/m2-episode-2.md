### Part I

If knowledge equals power, and power equals energy, and energy equals matter, and matter equals mass, then libraries are very dangerous places indeed. Not because they cause explosions, but because the explosions they cause happen inside your own head.

If you've read any of the works of Terry Pratchett, you'll recognize that I'm talking about what Pratchett calls 'L-Space', one of the great secrets of Librarianship. In essence, all books everywhere affect all other books - thus you can deduce the contents of books _not yet written_.

It's all pretty silly, but this week, you'll see that there's a bit of truth in it. In fact, the main task for this week is to explore over 20 000 archaeological journal articles, written in English, from about 1935 to 2010 ish. You can't possibly read all these articles. But you might be able to see macroscopic, large-scale trends in the things that these articles talk about. What I've done, in fact, is said to my computer: imagine there are 150 topics in these 20 000 articles. Please sort each article's words into the most likely topics, and show me the results. So the computer looks at each work, and its surrounding words, in each article, versus how that word is used in every other article. It imagines a world where writers pull words from different buckets in different proportions to write - and if you can imagine that, then you can get the computer to work backwards from the proportions to the original buckets.

I've already done the computational part, although I have tutorials that will show you how to do this, if you're interested. For making sense of more material than you can hope to read, a topic model is a great way to get this macroscopic view.

I want you to pay attention to the visualizations that we can produce from the topic models; look for inflection points or other interesting blips. Dive into the data - the topic model browser will show you the individual articles, all of which are available through JSTOR. Can you identify the trends that lead to the emergence of 'digital archaeology' as we understand it in this class? What about 'computational archaeology' - is that something different from 'digital archaeology'? If you need a framework to understand these inflection points, the Wikipedia article on 'archaeological theory' is not a bad place to start.

Knowledge = power = energy = matter = mass. Ideas become real because they dictate how we see and understand patterns in the material culture, and what we pay attention to and make real and end up calling 'archaeology'.
