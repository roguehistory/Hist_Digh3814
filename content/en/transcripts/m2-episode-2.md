### Storytime

Welcome to week 6, the halfway point of the course, and the last week before the fall reading week and Hallowe'en. I want to tell you about the library at the British School at Rome. Imagine a room two stories tall, lined with bookshelves. There's a walkway around where the second floor would be; you can go up a spiral steel staircase and browse those shelves up there, looking down on the scholars at their desks below. Each scholar in residence at the School has their favourite desk. People get quite attached to 'their' space. The school faces to the west, and in the afternoons, the light slants in through the huge high windows, bathing everything in a sleepy yellow glow. But as night falls, the shadows get longer, the building starts to cool, and soon there are only small pools of light where the dedicated still labour at their desks. After supper, no one is in the library. But say you open the little wooden door and step into the vast shadowy darkness... if you go up onto the upper walkway around about that time, and you wander over to the one bit of wall without any shelving, try placing a book on that empty shelf. You might look away if you hear something. When you look back, the book will be on the floor. They say the ghost of Eugenia Strong, once the assistant director of the school during WWII, still likes to work in the library at night, and uses this now blocked in doorway as her own personal entrance. She only throws the books over the edge.

So they say.

### Part I
I want to talk to you about libraries.

If knowledge equals power, and power equals energy, and energy equals matter, and matter equals mass, then libraries are very dangerous places indeed. Not because they cause explosions, but because the explosions they cause happen inside your own head.

If you've read any of the works of Terry Pratchett, you'll recognize that I'm talking about what Pratchett calls 'L-Space', one of the great secrets of Librarianship. In essence, all books everywhere affect all other books - thus you can deduce the contents of books _not yet written_.

It's all pretty silly, but this week, you'll see that there's a bit of truth in it. In fact, the main task for this week is to explore over 20 000 archaeological journal articles, written in English, from about 1935 to 2010 ish. You can't possibly read all these articles. But you might be able to see macroscopic, large-scale trends in the things that these articles talk about. What I've done, in fact, is said to my computer: imagine there are 150 topics in these 20 000 articles. Please sort each article's words into the most likely topics, and show me the results. So the computer looks at each word in each article, and its surrounding words, in each article, versus how that word is used in every other article. It imagines a world where writers pull words from different buckets in different proportions to write - and if you can imagine that, then you can get the computer to work backwards from the proportions to the original buckets.

I've already done the computational part, although I have tutorials that will show you how to do this, if you're interested. For making sense of more material than you can hope to read, a topic model is a great way to get this macroscopic view.

I want you to pay attention to the visualizations that we can produce from the topic models; look for inflection points or other interesting blips. Dive into the data - the topic model browser will show you the individual articles, all of which are available through JSTOR. Can you identify the trends that lead to the emergence of 'digital archaeology' as we understand it in this class? What about 'computational archaeology' - is that something different from 'digital archaeology'? If you need a framework to understand these inflection points, the Wikipedia article on 'archaeological theory' is not a bad place to start.

Knowledge = power = energy = matter = mass. Ideas become real because they dictate how we see and understand patterns in the material culture, and what we pay attention to and make real and end up calling 'archaeology'.
