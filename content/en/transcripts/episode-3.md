### Part I

Last week, I went to a graveyard not too far from my house. It took me about 15 minutes to walk there, crossing roads with heavy traffic. It's in the corner of a city park, underneath some trees. The ground _outside_ the little graveyard's precinct is lumpy and uneven, and, as I peer into the underbrush, I'm pretty certain that I'm seeing the foundation pit of a small structure. As I recorded the graves into our digital recording form, I got frustrated. The shape and designs of the stones _almost_ matches the example types from the 'Discovering England's Burial Spaces', but not quite. And so I have to make some decisions. Is it more like this type or _that_ type? I'm aware that as I make my decisions, I am _creating_ a record, and that the record is not the _thing_ itself... but as it becomes a data point, it takes on a different kind of materiality altogether.

The work of recording these stones is neither fast nor efficient. I make mistakes. I must've sat on the grass staring at the stone and flipping through my print out of the different types for 30 minutes, just for the one stone. In fact, when you think about it, this act of recording the stone is a bit like _close reading_. It forces me to pay attention to the material of the stone, the shape of its decorations, the motifs used, the verses inscribed, the names and relationships of the dead. One of the stones is for a small child, who passed away at 4 years of age. No details are given, but I think of my own children; I look at another stone and note the same date-of-death and realize that here is the mother, and I wonder at what calamity took them both.

It is in fact quite an emotional moment, I have no hesitation to share that. This week, you're continuing to record your stones. It does take a lot of time, but to do it well forces you to think about this interplay between the act of recording and the close reading of the material. Think about what is lost, and what is gained, by this act of recording. I wonder to myself, how do I record the _affective_ aspect of doing this work? Surely that's part of what a memorial to the departed is meant to achieve? What does our recording system _miss_?

This week, in addition to finishing your work in the graveyards, I want you to try to create 3d models of some of the stones. This too is a kind of close contemplation of a stone, because it takes care and effort to capture photos that can be stitched together into a model. When the light falls across the stones at an oblique angle, it can sometimes be easier to read the inscriptions; in a 3d model, when you digitally 'remove' the surface texture you can sometimes see the inscriptions in the model surface. For me, these models have 'aura' because they are imbued with the work, care, and attention that went into reading and recording the stones in the first place. Years ago, Walter Benjamin in a piece called 'The work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction' argued that a reproduction has no aura, no authenticity, that 'aura' was connected with the uniqueness of a thing; a reproduction has no _authority_ to speak about the thing reproduced. I have my doubts.

This week, you continue to put materials into a database, and you create digital representations of these materials. Think about what is created by these acts of digitization. Think about the emotional connection you may have with the material, think about how you've come to know this material. This is the day-to-day work of digital archaeology.
