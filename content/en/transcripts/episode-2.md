### Part I

This week you're going out into the field. But which field? When I was a kid, there was a graveyard on the other side of the dirt road from our farm. It had about six or seven headstones, and an old wrought-iron fence that surrounded the little plot. One stone was flat on the ground, at the centre of the graveyard. Almost like a lid. In fact, now that I think about it, it was probably a family vault, with soil backfilled around it. That would explain why this little burial ground was so much higher than the surrounding fields. Even when we bury our dead, we change the environment around us.

That graveyard fascinated me as a kid. Who were these people? Where did they come from? Where did they live? Was _my house_ their house? This was probably where my own journey into archaeology began, trying to understand how this little graveyard related to my house, my farm, and the nearby river. I didn't go there very often though; I was just a kid, and the place terrified me.

Mortuary archaeology, as I conceive of it, is about the study of burial customs and human remains. This week, we begin our graveyard project. There are a lot of ethical issues involved. Some of them are obvious, involving things like obtaining permission to go wandering over what is quite often private property. Some are more subtle, like, what obligations do we owe to the people we are studying, and to their descendents? Some issues only become apparent once we start obtaining data en masse, which is to say, the ethical issue emerges as we draw conclusions based on entire populations.

So: our fieldwork begins this field. Which field? Ideally, there is a graveyard not too far from where you are, that is accessible, and for which you can reasonably obtain permission to study. If you're in a smaller town, you might just be able to call up the office for the church or other institution responsible for the graveyard. For rural family plots like the one across the road from my childhood home, it could be more difficult. Some graveyards are run by modern corporations, and likely won't be bothered in the least if you quietly, and respectfully, begin to record information from the stones. Figuring this out will be your first challenge.

Recording the information will be your second challenge. The digital recording forms will work offline; you'll need to bring a smartphone or laptop with you with the forms pre-loaded and bookmarked. You could just use our recording scheme with a paper notebook, as well. 'Digital archaeology' doesn't always mean a device at every turn. The scheme we'll use was developed in Britain. You might find that it has assumptions about the study populations that are not always warranted; pay attention to when things don't fit!

My archaeological background is in Roman materials from central Italy. It was in petrology, and mineralogy, and epigraphy, and social networks. Canadian burials were not my area. As you go out this week, I will be recording as well. All of our data gets collated into a central database, and the results will be made available to you.

Graveyards are liminal spaces, and given the ways our cities have grown, are now sometimes in very out of the way or otherwise dodgy places. When you go out, ideally have someone from your social bubble go with you. Always tell people where you are going, and when you'll be back. Have a phone with you.
