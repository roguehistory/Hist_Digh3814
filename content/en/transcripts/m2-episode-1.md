### Part I

My job was to copy the information in the paper recording sheets into the Access Database. Each box on the form had a count for a different type of pottery. Each paper form had a digital analog on my screen. I got pretty fast at running my finger down the paper form, and banging in numbers on the keypad. But every so often, there'd be a horrible warning noise: computer says no. There was a ware recorded on the form, but not provided for in the computer's controlled vocabulary.

Computer says no. And so... that data did not get recorded.

You've made it through the first module of the course. Congratulations! Archaeological work records data in many different ways. There is a tension between the ways we've always done the work, the tried-and-true field methods, and the methods that are opening more worlds of experience to archaeological investigation. In short, there are as many 'digital archaeologies' as there are 'regular' archaeologies. The way we choose to look at archaeological data - the things we decide to record- dictates a lot of what we might see.

The point of the work in this second module is to unpack what you've just completed in the light of this idea. No doubt you've encountered the phrase, 'the act of observation changes that which is observed.' Terry Pratchett once noted that if it's true to say that, it's even more true to say that the thing observed also changes the observer. In archaeological terms, in data terms, this means that what gets counted, counts. _The archaeology doesn't exist, doesn't have meaning, until we go out and look for it_.

Insert puzzled Keanu meme here, eh?

This week, I want you to reflect on the ways the coding scheme we used for recording the graveyards failed. Then, I want you to take that scheme, modify it so that it's better, and re-implement it. You don't have to take it out and re-record everything (though you're welcome to do that if you want). Rather, I want you to see how your choices intersect with the decisions _already taken by the KoBoToolbox people_ to conspire to make your graveyard data observable.

Other tasks this week can include getting to know a bit about the statistical sofware R and the programming environment R Studio, and a bit of futzing about with databases.

### Part II

This week, we are joined by Colleen Morgan.

Hi I'm Colleen Morgan I am the lecturer in Digital Archaeology and Heritage in the department of archaeology at the University of York and I also co-direct the digital archaeology digital heritage masters programs. My current projects are the 'Aide Memoire project' and 'The Other Eyes project'. Aide Memoire is all about digital reporting in Archaeology. It's primarily about drawing and so really trying to understand what drawing is in archaeology and what it means that we are increasingly losing drawing within our archaeological toolkit. We've come on some really really interesting results as well. Needless to say, not only should we not stop drawing, continue drawing, but we should also be drawing more. More often, and probably during every single course you take. The other eyes project is about avatars in archaeology, so moving through is ethical for us to inhabit avatars of the past that are based on bioarchaeological remains and so that is continuing on; I'll be presenting a paper on that soon. 

I got started in digital archaeology way back almost 20 years ago with Dr. Maria Franklin, working in Dallas TX on the Thomas and Nora Comb site. They wanted a website for this excavation and they somehow understood that I had a few digital skills and so I went ahead and digitized some of their old photos, I made a very very basic and now gone website for them and I've just been doing that ever since. So at a certain point they sorta shooed me to go and work inside. I was a bit sad about that.

The biggest challenge facing digital archaeology at the moment? I think really showing that critical and impactful discoveries can be made through digital archaeology is not always all that easy to prove to funders that you're going to find out something new about the past through the application of digital methods because we don't always know what that thing will be - because so much of it is through indirect investigation and playful approaches. And that's what I really enjoy about it but it also can be difficult to find somebody to fund a lot of playing around. 

What drives me up the wall about how digital archaeology is currently received or perceived in the profession? I think going back to the Aide Memoire project - the way digital tools are used without understanding their impact on knowledge production in archaeology, without understanding what they're doing to our mental models of how we interpret and disseminate archaeology. 

What fills me with hope about the field? I think the way people are using digital methods to fight fascism, to try to change the colonial basis on which archaeological investigation is built, I think that's probably the most hopeful thing. I - me and a few others - have started a microgrants collective. It's called 'The Black Trowel Collective' and we give out microgrants to archaeology students from underserved communities and historically looted communities and so right now we're centering Black and Trans archaeology students, to try to give them a little bit of help in this very majority white field. 

Thank you for inviting me to this Shawn and I hope you all have a good term!
